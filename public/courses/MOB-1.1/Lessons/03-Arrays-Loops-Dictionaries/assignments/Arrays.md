# Arrays Practice

## Code the following challenges in a Swift Playground.


1. Define an array called  `suitcase`. It should store Strings. Imagine you are going on a trip and you need to put things in your suitcase. Use the append method to add the things you are going to take. You can only append one item at a time. Add at least 4 things to the suitcase.


2. Print the array `suitcase` to the console.


3. Using `suitcase`, print the item at index 3 to the console.


4. Given `var fruit = ["🍐", "🐍", "🍏", "🐶", "🍐", "🍋", "🍓"]` Remove the animals from the array of fruits.


5. Given the following array, insert **Apr** before **May**?

```
var months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "May"]
```

6. Write a function that takes an Array of String as an input and returns a String. The returned String should be all of the items in the input String with a space between each.

For example:

```
let str = arraytoString(array: ["Swift", "is", "fun!"])
print(str) // "Swift is fun!"
```

Call your function with an array of at least 5 words and print the results to the console.

Snaps if you don't have a space at the end! 😎
