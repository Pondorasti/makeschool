# Dictionaries Practice

## Code the following challenges in a Swift Playground.

1. Create an array where the key is the name of an app and the value is the time you spend on it daily. Enter a few examples.

2. Give the following dictionary. Access a hex value of a color.

```Swift
var colorHex: [String:String] = [
    "purple" : "#6C3483",
    "blue" : "#2874A6",
    "green": "#1E8449" ,
    "orange" : "#D35400",
    "yellow" : "#F1C40F",
    "white" : "#FFFFFF",
    "black" : "#000000"
]
```

Try to access the value in a safe way. ðŸ˜…

3. Try adding a new color `red` with hex #f20707. Then print the dictionary to see the change.

4. Delete any color from the dictionary. Then print the dictionary to see the change.
