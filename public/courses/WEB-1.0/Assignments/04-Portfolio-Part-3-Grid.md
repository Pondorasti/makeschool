# WEB 1.0 - CSS Grid - Redesign

## Description 

Use CSS Grid to redesign your personal homespage.  

### Why this assignment?

Designing on a grid will improve the appearance of your work by 100%. CSS Grid is a great tool useful with lots of uses. 

## Project requirements

Redesign your personal page focusing on using a grid based layout. Use the grid to organize your content and make your page look, read, and communicate your ideas better. 

Use CSS Grid for your layout. Arrange the elements and sections on a grid. 

Use `grid-areas` and `grid area` to arrange elements on a grid. Map your elements to grid fields using these two properties.

### GitHub

Previously we've been submitting assignments using files or zip files. Starting from here and going forward, we will be utilizing [GitHub](github.com) to store our work. This will help in building up your portfolio by showing recruiters and other engineers that you're actively building projects. It also allows you to more easily collaborate with times, and save the history of building your projects.

Why else should we use Git/GitHub? It helps prevent situations such as:

- “Damn! I lost all of my work!” 
- “Oh, no! The code I wrote yesterday was correct but I replaced it with a wrong code! How can I recover my previous code?”
- How can I go back in time?! (when I go, how would I go back to the future?!!)

Remember Git is a version control system (VCS) that helps you to save many ‘versions’ of your files as you’re writing or changing them. If you wanted to see or recover any of those ‘versions’, Git recovers it for you!

If you need a refresher, revisit the [Git/GitHub section of the Environment Setup tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/standalone/make-school-environment-setup-dsi/git-github) to help get you started.

<!-- Add examples of grid based design -->

### Deliverable

Your personal homepage - `index.html` and `index.css`. This version should use a grid based design and implement the grid with CSS Grid. 

Create a Repo on GitHub called `Personal Page`, and add your `index.html` and `index.css` files to it. When you submit using Gradescope, select the `GitHub` option for submitting a project, and follow the steps from there.

<!-- Add deliverable example -->

### Stretch Goals

Improve more your design in more than just the grid. 

Get feedback from your peers and incorporate it.

### Due date

Due Class 5 - Thu, Sept 3
