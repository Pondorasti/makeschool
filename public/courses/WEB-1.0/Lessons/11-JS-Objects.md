## Objects 

Objects are collections. What's a collection: 

Definition of collection

1 : the act or process of collecting
the collection of data
the collection of taxes

2a : something collected
especially : an accumulation of objects gathered for study, comparison, or exhibition or as a hobby
a collection of poems
a collection of photographs
a baseball card collection
b : GROUP, AGGREGATE
a collection of symptoms, such as fatigue, headaches, and joint pain
c : a set of apparel designed for sale usually in a particular season
the designer's spring collection of dresses

The defintion we'll focus on is:

2a : something collected
especially : an accumulation of objects

and 

b : GROUP, AGGREGATE

An Object in JavaScript is a collection of propertied and methods. 

Let's focus on Objects as a collection of properties for now. 

Side Note: In Python Objects are called Dictionaries. Objects are mostly the same. 

## Objects and Properties

An Object is defined like this: 

```JS
const obj = {}
```

The empty {} represents an object with not properties. 

```JS
const cat = { color: 'calico' }
```

Here defined an object with a single property. The syntax is `name: value`. 

You could add more properties like this: 

```JS
const cat = { color: 'calico', age: 5 }
```

Each new property is separated with a comma. 

You can add lines to make this easier to read: 

```JS
const cat = { 
  color: 'calico', 
  age: 5 
}
```

## Final Project

Read the description for the [Final Project](../Assignments/10-Final-Project.md)

### Wireframe

Before you leave class today create a wireframe for your project. Since it will be only a single page you'll only need a single wireframe image. 

### Create a Repo for your final 

Create a GitHub Repo and make your first commit.

### Assess yourself

Read the requiements for the final project ans ask youself:

- Which do have least experience with? 
- What is the subject?
- Where's your content?

### Start your final project

- Make an HTML page with the boilerplate tags
- Collect content for your final
  - **If you don't have content now use placeholders**
