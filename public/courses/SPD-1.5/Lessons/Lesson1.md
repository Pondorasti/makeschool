## 🔭 [05m] Class Overview
- Review course syllabus and high level understand of SPD 1.5

## 🏆 [05m] Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to...

1. Reflect on a previous portfolio project you created
1. Solve a sorting string problem
1. Explain the solution of the string problem to your peers
1. Implement the solution in a real world application

**Why should we learn this?**
- engineers should always be reviewing their work, documenting the lessons learned, and their successes!
- when approaching technical engineering challenges, solving a straightforward theoretical question before an applied question helps by drawing paralles between the two.
- nothing cements learning better than explaining to your peers--expect to have discussions with your team mates on a regular basis.

## 📚 [20m] Portfolio Project Audity 

Identify one of your strongest portfolio projects. Then, go to Gradescope and complete the assignment labeled "Portfolio Project Audit". 

## 🔥 [30m] Warm-Up: LeetCode Problem 

Random pair and share activity. 

Work together with your partner to solve the following LeetCode problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

Hints:
- The given input array has already been sorted! This means pointers could work well here...
- "In-place" means you must use the given array and no other data structures--could swapping play a role in this solution?

## 🗣️ [10m] Class Discussion on Solution

Call on pairs to share their work, explain the solution, and how their problem solving process.

## 🛏️ [10m] Break

## 🚜 [60m] Coding Activity

The instructor will walkthrough the code activity's `README` and details [hosted here on Repl.](https://replit.com/team/MSInterviewPrep/sortedUserIDs-PYTHON)

Random groups of 3-to-4 will then be formed to complete the `todo()` functions listed.

Hint:
- all solutions to the `todo()` functions can leverage the in-place solution from the LeetCode activity completed earlier in class!
- it may be possible to consolidate `todo()` functions--feel free to do so if that makes things easier for you

## ☮️ [5m] Vibe Check

- Discuss thoughts and feelings about the class structure and what we want to learn in this class.
- Take a quick Zoom poll


## 💪 Q&A + Wrap Up 

- Share and review solutions for the coding activity
- Think about how this activity relates to interview questions, what parallels can we draw?
- Identify other portfolio projects you'd like to audit and how you can prepare them to score higher
