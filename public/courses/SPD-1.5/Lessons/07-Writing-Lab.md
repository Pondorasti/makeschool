## 🏆 [05m] Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to...

1. Reflect on the feedback provided to you by peers
1. Create a blog post for your final project

## 📚 [20m] What HackerNews Likes

Form breakout rooms and take a look at [the highest rated HackerNews articles of all time.](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/hacker-favourites-analysis)

What common elements can you identify in the top 10 articles?

Make a list of inspirations that you want to capture for your final project's written components.

## 🔬 [10m] Provide User Validation

As a class, take 10 minutes to create written responses to various final project statements that students have made in the `spd-jr` channel!

Help out your fellow students by supporting them as they put their energy out there.

## 🔥 [30m]  Writing Time 

Group up with your team, or cross collaborate with others.

Use this as an oppurtunity to put everything you envision in your final project together! Create a Google Doc or other sharable document for your final project deliverables.

Feel free to reuse content from any slack channel posts and integrate what your peers responded with.

Here's some potential reflecting points to get you started in the process if you can't think of anything else to write:
- What challenge were you facing that caused you to create this project? It could be an assignment from class, but could it be more?
- How did you identify the technologies (frameworks, optimizations, etc.) that could be used to resolve this challenge? 
- Did the challenge get overcome, why or why not?
- What important engineering or life lessons did you learn along the way?
- Whats the number one thing you want readers taking away from this article?

## 🛏️ [10m] Break

## 🚜 [-m] Work Time

Use the remainder of time to form groups and get some work done! Next week will be focused on getting things into production.
