# DS-2.9 Technical Seminar

## Course Description

The goal of this course is to produce a fantastic, well-documented Data Science Portfolio Project.

### Why should I take this course?

Building a successful portfolio project will transform you into a real Data Scientist. You will become an expert on your chosen topic area, and along the way you will encounter, struggle with, and learn how to overcome real world problems similar to those you might face at your first job. Your completed project will showcase your skills and demonstrate your ability as a Data Scientist to the world -- and to prospective employers.

## Assignment Submissions

We will be using [Gradescope](gradescope.com), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.


### The Portfolio Project

- [Project Description](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-2.9-Technical-Seminar/blob/master/portfolio_project.md)
- [Project Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1Pt7DkrWeSmoxqHpHdN2eFl2XBYV9EJFGELUn3uK_g/edit?usp=sharing)
- Students can optionally add value to their portfolio project by writing a blog article and publishing in [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/), [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/), or another suitable online magazine.


## Evaluation

Grade is composed of Project Milestones and In-class Quizzes, as follows:

- Milestone 1: 10 points
- Milestone 2: 10 points
- Milestone 3: 10 points
- Milestone 4: 10 points
- Milestone 5: 10 points
- Milestone 6: 40 points
- Milestone 7: 10 points
- In-class Quizzes: 50 points

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:
- Complete **each** of the 7 Portfolio Project Milestones with a passing grade (i.e. 70%) according to the associated rubric
- Project Milestones that are not passed on the first attempt may be re-submitted within a week of the original due date for a second try, at a cost of 10% of the score. I.e., a re-submitted 10 point Milestone can get a maximum score of 9 points. There is no third try.
- Complete Quizzes with an overall passing grade (i.e. 70% of all the Quiz points, after the worst quiz is dropped). No re-tries for Quizzes.

## [Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1i2jwXqx__URpWvUf8z8E9iwcdJ05QsPnbjs7Z83Us/preview#)

Students are expected to practice academic integrity in all of its forms, including abstaining from plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic misconduct. Make School reserves the right to determine in any given instance what action constitutes a violation of academic honesty and integrity.
Plagiarism, defined as the practice of presenting another's work or ideas as one’s own, is an act of academic dishonesty and is a serious ethical and scholarly violation.  

Copying text or ideas, whether verbatim or by paraphrasing from a source without using proper citation, is not accepted at Make School. Any materials incorporated into your work, regardless of format, must be properly acknowledged using a citation style appropriate for the discipline of the course.

Though plagiarism may be the most common form, other violations of scholarly integrity also constitute cheating, including:
- Using or copying information from another student’s code or written work;
- Copying information from another student’s test or using unauthorized materials during an examination, whether an in-class or take-home exam;
- Buying, selling, or stealing test questions, answers, or term papers;
- Doing work or taking tests on behalf of another student or submitting work done by another person;
- Falsifying data or laboratory results; and
- Submitting the same work for more than one course without explicit instructor approval.

If an incident of plagiarism or cheating occurs, the instructor will investigate the incident and consult with the Dean. If the student has been found to have committed an act of academic dishonesty, an [Academic Misconduct Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUBN68KkiOyXoynNwBrc89zb5Tr-Z0g0aCpNqbgNzCBm1uGQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) will be filed and the student will be placed on a [Participation Improvement Plan (PIP)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1i2jwXqx__URpWvUf8z8E9iwcdJ05QsPnbjs7Z83Us/preview#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr). A student who believes they have been wrongly accused of plagiarism or cheating, or that the instructor’s resolution of the alleged incident is unjust, may file a [Request for Appeal of Disciplinary Action](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1i2jwXqx__URpWvUf8z8E9iwcdJ05QsPnbjs7Z83Us/preview#heading=h.8obtx3h2p3mr).
