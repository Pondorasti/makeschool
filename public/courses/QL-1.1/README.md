# QL 1.1 - Mathematical Thinking and Quantitative Reasoning

## Course Description

The goal of Mathematical Thinking and Quantitative Reasoning is to help students develop intellectual mathematical abilities as well as see mathematics as a method to address current problems including social problems. Understanding how people learn from data will change the way students think about the world. Students will use state of the art data exploratory methods to analyze real data. Topics will include modern statistical reasoning, statistical modeling, linear regression, statistical inference, logarithmic and exponential modeling, and the conditions for inference which must hold in order to use statistical procedures.  Other topics include logical reasoning, analysis of arguments, probability.

## Prerequisites:  

None

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to ...

1. Develop capacities of quantitative reasoning to interpret, analyze, apply, and explain data (information) presented in mathematical forms.
1. Recognize and evaluate assumptions in estimation, modeling, and data analysis.
1. Calculate mathematical problems and communicate quantitative evidence in support of an argument.
1. Apply quantitative reasoning skills using data analysis, probability, and statistics through examples related to current world debates, inquiries, and problems.
1. Gain and act with confidence to work through problems using quantitative reasoning.

## Critical Skills

Explain, use, and implement the following statistical tools using Python

1. Use Mean, Mode, Median, Range, and Standard Deviation to describe a data series
2. Diagram and use the Histogram, PDF, and CDF of a data series
3. Calculate the Correlation and Covariance of two features of a data set
4. Calculate the Probability and Conditional Probability of an event or events
5. Define what vectors and matrixes are, and complete matrix-vector multiplication
6. Explain what derivatives and partial derivates are and use them to perform linear regression on a dataset.

## Assignment Schedule

We will be using Gradescope, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at https://gradescope.com/reset_password. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

| Assignments               | Due Date     | Submission Form |   |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|---|
| Mean, Median and Mode     | Refer to Gradescope | Gradescope      |   |
| Median and Mode Algorithm | Refer to Gradescope | Gradescope      |   |
