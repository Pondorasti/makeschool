### [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YEGEh2bhklbZKmMpN8dvfLMSsdutSMka1R6aCOlmFdA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you should be able to...

1. Implement iterative & recursive versions of Depth-first search (DFS).
1. Find a path between two vertices using Depth-first search.
1. Identify uses for Depth-first Search.

## Activity 1: Solving a Maze

With a group of 3, solve the maze puzzle:

- Pretend you are walking in the maze and can only see what’s right in front of you. You have a long piece of string so that you can see where you’ve already visited. With your group, come up with a strategy for solving any maze.
- Go to [this Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1yVxwgqIGvnqdKZUPsZOUaqOr6hAVpDiQVpc5Juje-sU/edit?usp=sharing) and trace the path you would follow, using the strategy you came up with in part 1.

## Activity 2: Complete a Depth-first Search

With a group of 3, complete Depth-first Search on the graph shown below. Make a copy of [this Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1u3OxPz2ca6pl93NPqdTIYMeiO0xZGlOagmrSUbYDCRg/edit?usp=sharing) to get started.

## BREAK

## Activity 3: Cycle Detection

With your group of 3, choose who will be the driver, the navigator, and the observer.

- Driver: Share your screen & type in code according to the navigator’s instructions
- Navigator: Decide what to do next & how to solve the problem
- Observer: Give feedback and help your group if they are stuck!

Write pseudocode and then real code for the following method:

```py
class Graph:
   def contains_cycle(self):
       """Return True if the graph contains a cycle, False otherwise."""
       # ...
```
