# CS 2.2 Final Project

## Project Description

For this project, you will submit 2 videos of algorithm explanations. This will allow you to practice communication skills & will solidify your understanding of graph algorithms.

## Project Requirements

1. **Choose 2 algorithms** that we've covered during the class. If you wish to use BFS or DFS, please choose an application of those algorithms (e.g. Bipartite or Cycle Detection).
1. For each chosen algorithm, make a video that accomplishes the following:
  - Describes and illustrates a **real-world application** of the algorithm. To illustrate, you can use a whiteboard, pen & paper, Google slides, drawings, etc.
  - Explains how to transform the real-world example into a graph.
  - Illustrates using the algorithm to solve a **specific** version of the problem (e.g. "I have these ten friends: Amy, Bernard, Chase with these friendships...") similar to how we've done in class.
  - Explains, using beginner-friendly language, how to write code to implement the algorithm to solve the given problem.

## Rubric


| **Criteria** | Needs Improvement  |  Basic (Passing) | Proficient |
| :---------: | :-------: | :------: | :------: |
| **Desribes & illustrates real-world example** | Video does not describe a real-world example, or gives an example that is too vague. | Video describes & illustrates a concrete real-world example, but does not illustrate exactly how to model it using a graph. | Video describes & illustrates a real-world example, and explains how to turn that real-world example into a graph. |
| **Solves a specific instance of the problem** | Does not solve a specific instance of the problem, or explains in vague terms without giving a step-by-step solution. | Gives a step-by-step solution of how to solve the problem using the chosen algorithm, but may contain minor mistakes or misunderstandings. | Explains in detail how to solve the problem step-by-step. |
| **Explains how to write code to implement the algorithm** | Does not explain code step-by-step, and instead gives a vague explanation or overview | Gives a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm that a beginner could follow, but may contain minor mistakes or misunderstandings. | Thoroughly explains each step of the algorithm as it pertains to the example. |

A passing project earns an average score of 2 (Basic) across both video submissions.

## Examples

For inspiration, check out algorithm explanation videos on YouTube such as [this video on BFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDqjPvD54Ss).

## Video Recording Software

You can use the [QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl923?locale=en_US) recording sofware to record a screen capture video, or the Photo Booth software to take a video with your webcam. No need to edit your video or use any fancy software! 

## Submission
