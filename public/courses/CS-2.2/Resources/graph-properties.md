##Graph Properties
A brief summary of the properties discussed in class - for a complete list see [Graph Properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_property)or [Glossary of graph theory terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms)

- **Vertex Neighbors / Neighborhood:** The set of vertices adjacent to the vertex.
- **Connected Graph:** A graph is connected if there is a path from each vertex to all the other vertices.
- **Connected Component:** The connected components of a graph are the maximal subgraphs that are (individually) connected.
- **Walk:** A walk is a sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices.
- **Directed Walk: ** A directed walk is a sequence of arcs in the same direction which join a sequence of vertices.
- **Path:** - A path is a sequence of vertices reached by their adjacent edges where no vertex is repeated.
- **Cycle:** - A cycle is a sequence of vertices reached by their adjacent edges that starts and ends on the same vertex and has no other repeated vertices.

- **Directed Cycle:** A directed cycle is a sequence of vertices reached by their adjacent arcs in the same direction that starts and ends on the same vertex and has no other repeated vertices.


## Graph Invariants (Quantitative Properties)
- **Vertex Degree:** The number of edges adjacent to the vertex. The number of neighbors.

-  **Diameter:**
