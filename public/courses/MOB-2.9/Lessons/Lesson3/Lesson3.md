## Learning Objectives

1. Identify your team for the term
1. Define roles for each team member
1. Understand the workflow for each sprint
1. Set up the Kanban board

## Teams

Identify your team members, create a slack channel

- Team 1Ô∏è‚É£: Anika, Cao, Henry, Mo

- Team 2Ô∏è‚É£: Ben, Jess, Mark, Nick, Samuel

Identify if you would like to focus an area of the project:

- **Front-End** (UI/UX, Handling user input)
- **Back-End** (Modeling data, Networking or Persistence layers, Quality of Information)
- **Accessibility** (Ensuring the project complies to accessibility standards)

Everyone can work on different areas within the same sprint.

## SCRUM

- Standup at the beginning of each class
- Use Github Organization
- Use Github Boards & Templates
- Define workflow per sprint
- Define any team specific rules

## Workflow

Recommended workflow:

- Each feature gets a new branch.
- To submit your new feature to main, submit a PR.
- Add another developer to code review your PR.
- Team lead or Eng Manager approve the PR.
- You can move on to the next task üòé

When you associate a PR with an issue, the cards should automatically update in the board.

Goals for today:

- Getting to know the project (you can download the app to see how it works)
- Setting up the GitHub board for the team: Use the original board to copy over the tasks your team decides to work on, during the next weeks.
  - For each ticket in the board, assign story points (everyone in the team should agree on these).
  - Assign tickets to milestones.
  - Confirm the sprints with Eng. Manager
- Once the board has been approved, make the first ticket assignations.
