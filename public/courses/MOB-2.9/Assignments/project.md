### Team-based

Students will be assigned into small groups to work on a copy of the repository.
They will take on different team roles to tackle multiple areas of the project including:

- Front-End (UI/UX, Handling user input)
- Back-End (Modeling data, Networking or Persistence layers, Quality of Information)
- Accessibility (Ensuring the project complies to accessibility standards)

A student can work on different areas within the same sprint.

### Github board

Tracking the progress of the project will be done using Github boards.

- Milestones - serve as **sprints**
- Issues - serve as **user stories**

Sprints have already been setup, including due dates. Issues have descriptions and labels to help students with assignation and value estimations.

Here's an example of a [Github board](https://github.com/MOB-2-9/Petulia-Open/projects/1).<br>
