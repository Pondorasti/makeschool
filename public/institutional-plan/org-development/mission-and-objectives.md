# Mission and Objectives

*Staff area owner and author: Ashu Desai (Founder)*

As an organization, we prioritize our work and innovation to support our mission, 3–5 year objective, and 2020/2021 key metrics.

### Our mission:
Make School’s mission is “To create avenues of upward mobility for students of all backgrounds, empowering them to contribute to society through science and technology innovation.” We fulfill this mission by serving a majority under-resourced and underrepresented student population through our BACS degree program that is explicitly designed to counter systemic barriers to upward mobility and prepare students for high-earning careers.

### Our values:
Make School’s mission is upheld by the following values:
- Students-first - we put student needs first when making decisions and protect students’ investment in their education through innovative financing options.
- Innovation - we operate using progressive organizational principles, cutting-edge education methodologies, and regular experimentation.
- Relevance - we develop curriculum and partnerships to ensure the education we provide prepares students for productive careers in industry and to be engaged members of civil society.
- Equity & Growth - we analyze our actions and decisions through the lenses of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in order to create a more equitable future for all. We serve students traditionally underrepresented in the technology industry. We provide educational resources and mentorship to help students and staff develop a growth mindset and achieve personal growth.
- Citizenship - our students actively engage with their communities and create positive social impact. Students work on projects and seek employment to help solve key societal problems. Students formalize their ethical frameworks, practice empathy, respect diversity, and reject bias.
- Transparency - our policies, practices, planning, offerings, and student outcomes are hosted on a public-facing, version-controlled platform. Our affiliations with partners are publicly disclosed. 

### Our 3–5 year objective is:
To build the largest, sustainable Computer Science bachelor's program in the country, with top quality outcomes, and a student body representative of America.

For context, the largest Computer Science programs in the country are 500-1000 students. Sustainable means we have financial stability and we aren't burning out our team. Top quality outcomes mean on par with top CS programs. A student body representative of America means our student demographics should reflect the demographics of 18-24 year olds in America.

### Our 2020/2021 key metrics are:
- Placing 95% of our grads in jobs that average $90k+ annual salary
- 60 student Net Promoter Score (a measure of student satisfaction)
- Reach independent accreditation
- Financial stability
- 60 team member Net Promoter Score (a measure of team satisfaction)
- 150 incoming students with 30% women and non-binary and 40% underrepresented students of color
- 30% of new hires and new board members to be underrepresented people of color, 50% to be women and non-binary

### Growth beyond 2020
We don't have a concrete student growth target beyond Fall 2021. As a young and growing organization, we feel it's important to stay responsive to new information, constraints, and feedback. We will evaluate our financial and operational constraints during our annual planning period this summer to establish a targets for 2022. We are aiming to balance our financial stability (which improves with a larger student body) with maintaining high student satisfaction and top quality outcomes.
