Employers will look at your Github. You want it to be presentable to prospective employers, so let's clean it up a bit!

## What makes a good repo?

You want to give a professional look to your GitHub. Would you read a repo that was just a wall of text? A solid repo should include at least the following:

- Images/visual examples for descriptions instead of text
- Proper syntax highlighting/code blocks
- Example usage of the code
- Cleanly organized sections of the repo (i.e. using the markdown headers to create sections). Don't just make one big README
- Link to external libraries used, resources, additional information, etc.

For examples of what makes a presentable repo, check out [this template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2), or better yet, this [curated list of awesome READMEs](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme).
