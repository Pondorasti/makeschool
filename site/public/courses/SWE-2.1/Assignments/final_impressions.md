# Final Impressions

This was one of your first experiences with industry, and you’re going to want to make a good impression. **Best case could be you’re handed a full-time offer!** During the last few days of your internship, do the following to make a lasting impression:

1. Verbally thank your supervisor and hiring manager for the opportunity, emphasizing how much you’ve learned and grown
1. Email/Slack the company thanking everyone for the experience, provide forms of contact (email, LinkedIn, phone number, etc.)
1. Collect business cards/contact info/LinkedIn connections if you haven’t already
