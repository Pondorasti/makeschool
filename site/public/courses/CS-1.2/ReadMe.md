# CS 1.2: Introduction to Data Structures

## Course Description

This course looks under the hood at data structures and algorithms to see how arrays, linked lists and hash tables work. Students will build these structures from scratch, analyze complexity, and benchmark performance in an application to gain an understanding of real-world tradeoffs. Students will write scripts, functions, and library modules to use text processing tools like regular expressions, construct and sample probability distributions to create a Markov language model and gain insight into how grammar works and introductory natural language processing techniques.


## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: online | 7 weeks | 13 sessions

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Implement linear and non-linear data structures, including: stacks, queues, singly linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs.
1. Understand the advantages and applications of different data structures.
1. Implement iterative and recursive search and sorting algorithms.
1. Analyze the time and space complexity of iterative and recursive algorithms.
1. Solve open ended real-world and interview problems and select appropriate data structures/algorithms based on requirements.

## How to Get Help
**Office Hours:** \
Come to CoWork (refer to college calenadr) to see your TAs and Instructor. But usually it's faster to get help by using Piazza! (read below).

**Piazza:** \
The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza so everyone can benefit from the response. \
[Ask a question on Piazza →](https://make.sc/cs1.2-piazza)

**CoWork:** \
CoWork is a place to study with your peers with access to staff/TA support if needed. \
*Check your calendar for when CoWork is oferred, or contact Ian or Lisa. Join at [make.sc/cowork-zoom](make.sc/cowork-zoom)*
