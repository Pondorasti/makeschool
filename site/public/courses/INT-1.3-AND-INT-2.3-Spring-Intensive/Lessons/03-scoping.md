## Why you should know this or industry application

Getting overwhelmed by features or the scale of a project is a very real issue that engineers face when building a product. It can be challenging to implement features when there's not a clear idea of what's being built, or why you're building it.

By being able to scope your product and define what the MVP is, it will be easier to build out and continue to iterate and improve upon going forward. This also allows for an easier time explaining the product if you are focusing on only its core features. You should be able to easily explain your product to anyone in a concicse manner, and scoping will help you achieve that!

## Housekeeping/Agenda/Learning Outcomes (1 min)

### Housekeeping

Update [Spring Intensive Tracker:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15EY3XHtl9sFqwbSW_EmUFhiQvBLQfpRoFxQFO1KmnOM/edit#gid=0)

1. Ensure columns B-L are filled
1. Log your accomplishments from yesterday
1. Mark Attendance (in seperate attendance tab)

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, students should be able to…

1. Define what makes scoping easy/hard for them
1. Break a product down into its core features
1. Define what resources are needed in order to build a feature
1. Create a mission statement for their product 

### Agenda

- Warmup Scoping Activity
- Review of Scoping
- How to Scope an MVP
- MVP Feature Writing Activity
- What’s a Mission Statement?
- Mission Statement Writing Activity


## Slack Poll (1 min)

Use Slack to poll the class the following question: “What is the hardest part of scoping for you?”

1. “Too many features, can’t complete them all in time” 
1. “Not enough features, product falls short” 
1. “Uncertainty on what to build”


## Scoping Review (3 min)

- Review waterfall vs agile models
- We generally envision the car or the rocketship as the product. This is good to keep in mind, but we first need to envision the skateboard, and how to build that first


## The Elite's Skateboard Activity (5 min)

1. Think of some apps you use on a daily or weekly basis. What would the MVP of those be?
1. Once you have 1-2 apps in mind, talk to your neighbor and discuss

## The Elite's Skateboard TT (5 min)

- Provide three examples of big tech companies and what their MVP was
- Showcase that everyone starts out with the only the minimum needed to validate their idea

## MVP Prioritziation  (10 min)

With your group/team, begin filling out the Scoping MVP worksheet:
http://make.sc/scoping-worksheet

**Stretch Challenge:** Finish the worksheet and get instructor/TA feedback!

## Building an MVP TT (5 min)

Questions to ask yourself:

- What problem are you solving?
-  What are the minimum amount of features needed to solve that problem?
    - Build just enough to validate your idea
- Who are your target users?

An MVP does **not** mean:

- Releasing a broken product
- Releasing a product your users won’t find appealing

## Feature Writing Activity (15 min)

Get with your team and come up with one MVP feature for your product and make sure to include at least the following:

- User story
- Basic Requirements
- Time estimate (i.e. story points)
- Resources needed (i.e. TA/Instructor help, learning a new framework, etc.)
- **Add this to the tracker when you’re done**

## Mission Statement TT (4 min)

- A mission statement is a concise statement on what your product is, who it is for, and why it benefits users to use your product
- Ensures you can concisely explain your product
- Acts as a north stare for you and your team to build against
- Provide some examples of mission statements

## Mission Statement Writing Actvity (10 min)

With your team, come up with a mission statement for your product. Make sure it includes the following:

- Who your user base is
- Product name
- What the benefit(s) are
- What the technical component(s) is that allows the user to achieve that benefit
- **Add this to the Tracker when you’re done**

## Summary (1 min)

- A product vision should be an iterative progression, where each milestone is a complete, shippable product
    - Skateboard → Rocketship!
- Every big tech company started out with a stripped down product
- Find the core features for the MVP of your product that will satisfy the needs of your user base
- Mission statements will help not only concisely convey your product to anyone, but also ensure you and your team have a north star to reference when building
