Recommended workflow:

- Each feature gets a new branch.
- To submit your new feature to main, submit a PR.
- Add another developer to code review your PR.
- Team lead or Eng Manager approve the PR.
- You can move on to the next task üòé

When you associate a PR with an issue, the cards should automatically update in the board.

## Wrap Up (5 min)

Next class:

- Prepare your update for the stand up. Turn it in individually on Gradescope.
- If there's a technical concept you or your team are struggling with, send me a DM. We can spend time next class on it.

## Lab time (50 min)
