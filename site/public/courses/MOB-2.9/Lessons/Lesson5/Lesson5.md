## Learning Objectives

1. Code Reviews
1. Conduct a Sprint Retrospective
1. Deliver a Demo
1. If there are more sprints pending, conduct Sprint Planning

<!-- > -->

## Code Reviews

Before conducting a sprint retrospective, take the next 20-30 minutes to complete any pending code reviews or PR approvals.

## Sprint Retrospective + Planning

üìù [Minute template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18N2cIbw-1b__1i5oXUs5c8VryNxve-2F7R9l6jQJTAM/edit?usp=sharing)

1. üßê **Review** (~10 min)
- Demo: What is Done? Don't spend time showing incomplete features.
- Calculate Velocity (Did you achieve more or less than planned?)

<!-- > -->

2. ü§î **Retrospective** (~15 min)
- What went well? That the team should keep doing.
- What didn‚Äôt go well? And how can it be changed?
- Acknowledgements / Shout-Outs
- Planned Improvements

<!-- > -->

3. ü§ì **Sprint Planning** (~20 min)
- Populate New Tasks/Pending Tasks in Backlog
- Assign task ownership

<!-- > -->

- You will conduct a sprint retrospective with your team. Submit the minute in Gradescope.
- Prepare a short demo of what's done and then present to stakeholders (in this case just the Eng. Manager)

<!-- > -->

## CoWork (1hr 30min)

Use this time to:

- Attend requested meetings (if applicable)
- Work in breakout rooms (solo/in teams/with a partner)
- Work in the main room
- Design interfaces before coding
- Research before coding
- Pair program
- Ask technical questions
- Complete assigned tasks
- Submit PRs
- Deliver Code Reviews
- Accept PRs (if that's in your role)

<!-- > -->

## Workflow

![workflow](../Images/workflow.png)

<!-- > -->

Recommended workflow:

- Each feature gets a new branch.
- To submit your new feature to main, submit a PR.
- Add another developer to code review your PR.
- Team lead or Eng Manager approve the PR.
- You can move on to the next task üòé

When you associate a PR with an issue, the cards should automatically update in the board.

<!-- > -->

## Wrap Up (5 min)

Next class:

- Prepare your update for the stand up. Turn it in individually on Gradescope.
- If there's a technical concept you or your team are struggling with, send me a DM. We can spend time next class on it.

<!-- > -->

## Lab time

- More Cowork time or async work üòé
- If your team allows it, you can also work offline
