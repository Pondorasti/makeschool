## Course Description

This course will investigate the relevance of gender, race and sexuality to understanding equity in technology and the development of new technologies.

## Class Assignments

We will be using [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/235159), which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. *All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.*

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

Make School nurtures attitudes and behaviors that promote global awareness, inclusivity, and respect for the dignity of each person regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, culture, political conviction, religion, or disability. We are committed to creating an environment in which every individual can work, study, and live without feeling excluded, unsafe, or harassed.

During classrooms discussions, you may encounter opposing and different views with your classmates, and that is totally fine. In fact, I welcome a diverse array of opinions. Part of a healthy discussion is being able to discuss those differences clearly and respectfully. Sometimes, you may think your classmates’ questions are “stupid,” but they deserve the same level of respect from you as you wish from them. You can expect me to be fair, and I will not tolerate any hate speech (e.g. any attacks on another person’s identity, background, life experiences) in class. If the need arises, I will respectfully ask you to leave the discussion/zoom room.

Make School’s desire to foster a professional environment that honors the freedom of expression is equally balanced with pursuit to create an inclusive living and learning environment.
