# Title 

## Course Description

Term two focuses on the foundational skills of successful engineering teams. In pairs, you'll build an app using “lean product development” methodology, the industry standard for engineering team collaboration. You'll learn SCRUM planning, an agile process used to ensure that your app meets user needs and technical specifications. This class also covers how to make a seamless user experience (UX) based in an effective user interface (UI). We utilize design concepts inherent in the world’s most popular apps: information hierarchy, landing pages, system state, onboarding teardowns, typography and color. By the end you and your partner will ship a beautiful app that delights users.
