# Core Term 5 (for Juniors) and Term 10 (for Seniors)

Time to apply to jobs.

We'll start with a 2 day workshop on finding companies and writing cover letters. This will ensure that your application is well organized and focused.

Classes will focus on the post application skills: behavioral interviews, negotiation, on-boarding at a new company. There will also be plenty of structured lab time for you to get support from instructors as you apply.

The Make School staff is waiting and eager to connect you to startups and companies in our network: HR professionals, alumni, friends at YC companies and tech giants, and more. Please reach out.

Juniors will apply to internships. Seniors will apply to full time jobs.

We are also on hand to help you negotiate your contract and assess which company is the best fit.
