# Core Term 3 (for Juniors) & 7 (for Seniors)

Think Big.

After winter break, core class focuses on a big group project with teams of 4-5 engineers. You'll specialize in a particular role (front end, back end, etc) and execute an ambitious project to impact the world.

Previous projects include:
* A website, designed in partnership with the White House, to educate and connect underserved communities to the Internet.
* An online marketplace to find and purchase iOT home appliances.
* A "smart curriculum" that creates tests off of student work.

Your team will dive deep into the nuance of an industry, talk with experts in the field, and create something meaningful.

We'll cover organizational psychology research on what makes teams thrive. You'll get hands on experience navigating team dynamics and troubleshooting common communication challenges.

Juniors and Seniors will both be in this class. Seniors are expected to take a leadership role on teams.

Core culminates with Demo Night presentations of shipped product. It's a stellar opportunity to showcase your work to the larger Make School network and share what you've learned.
