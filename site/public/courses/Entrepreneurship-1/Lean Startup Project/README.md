## Entrepreneurship I - Lean Startup Project

You can move at your own pace through this process, and you must turn in each deliverable before moving on to the next step. If you invalidate an idea and want to change ideas, that is OK, when you go back to the beginning of these steps you will get faster and faster at going through them.

1. **Idea** - Pick an idea and write out a business model canvas and elevator pitch
1. **Assumptions** - Brainstorm your riskiest possible assumptions and tests to test them (RATs)
1. **RATs** - Conduct RATs to derisk your idea
  - User Interviews
1. **Marketing Funnel** - Create a Marketing Funnel
  - Landing Page
  - Analytics
1. **Growth Campaigns** - Conduct growth campaigns and log three numbers
  - Impressions (optional)
  - Clicks
  - Conversions

### Brainstorm at Least 10 Original Ideas

Turn in a list of 10 or more original ideas

### Develop your Idea: Business Model Canvas & Elevator Pitch

Out of the ten+ ideas that you generated during the ideation process, pick a few and complete and turn in **The Business Model Canvas** and write an **Elevator Pitch**

An **Elevator Pitch** should take 1 minute to deliver and should contain the following parts:

1. Who is your customer?
1. What problem are you solving for them?
1. How do they solve this problem today?
1. What is your solution?
1. What are three of its benefits (not features, benefits)

Discuss the **The Business Model Canvases** and **Elevator Pitches** with the instructor. Pick one and turn it in.

### Identify Risky Assumptions

For the idea you've chose and developed, now make a **List of Assumptions** that you are making about the business's value proposition.

Force rank this **List of Assumptions** by how risky the assumption is. The most risky assumptions will kill the business if they are not true. Lower level risk assumptions will change the total size of the business' market. The lowest level will have no material impact on the business.

Turn in your list before moving on to the next step.

# Make Your RATs

Your top three risks and any risk that will lead to death are your **Riskiest Assumptions**.

Now design **Riskiest Assumption Tests** for each of your riskiest assumptions.

But how do you test these risky assumptions? RATs must be customized to each assumption. However, there are some common forms of RATs.

1. User Interviewing - See 10 Commandments of User Interviewing at the bottom.
1. Signups from Landing Page
1. Surveying signups from your landing page
1. Interviewing an expert
1. Researching the Competitive Landscape
1. Interview an existing competitor
1. Etc.

**IMPORTANT - DEBIASING** - Like a journalist tries to debiase their coverage of a topic or a microbiologist keeps a sterile environment to avoid confounding their experiments, entrepreneurs have to deliberately remove showing their own biases as they conduct their RATs. Otherwise, you will just be confirming your own bias, instead of actually discovering the truth about the value and viability of your business.

Turn in your RATs plans before moving on to the next step.

### Conduct Your RATs

Now its time to actually run your RATs.

Turn in your findings, interview notes, your landing page, etc before moving onto the next step.

### Design Marketing Funnel

Now that you've derisked your business idea, its time to really validate it by proving to yourself that your customer wants it. The best way to do this is to prove that you can grow it, even a little bit.

Entrepreneurs use the concept from marketing called a **Marketing Funnel** to strategize how to grow a product. It breaks down growth into multiple phases. Here is a simplified list:

1. Awareness - someone becomes aware that your product exists.
1. Consideration - someone views our product and considers buying it.
1. Conversion - someone purchases your product.
1. Reactivation - someone purchases your product again or subscribes.
1. Evangelism - someone promotes your product to others by word-of-mouth.

Companies use different strategies at each of these stages to promote the growth of their products. Each stage has a percentage rate, for example:

Say you do a Facebook ad and 1000 people see our advertisement. Of those 1000 **impressions**, 100 visit your website. The conversion rate from Awareness to Consideration was 10% (really good!). Now of those 100 that are considering buying your product, 7 make a purchase - making the conversion rate from Consideration to Conversion 7% (really good again!). Now of those 7 who make a purchase, 4 buy again the next month when we send out your monthly newsletter. That is like a 57% conversion rate from Conversion to Reactivation. Finally we give all customers their own sharable coupon link and out of those 7, 3 people share the link and bring in new customers for us. So 43% conversion from Conversion to Evangelism. This is a healthy marketing funnel!

To start with we are going to focus on strategies that will help people move from **Consideration** to **Conversion**, and then we'll do some strategies to gain some **Awareness** after conversion is setup.

Common strategies for increasing this rate (the conversion rate):

1. Being clear about why people want the product.
1. Being clear about what they are getting, what the product is.
1. Being clear about pricing.
1. Social proof - ratings, reviews, testimonials, and recommendations
1. Media - images and videos

Turn in strategies you will use to increase people moving from **Consideration** to **Conversion**
