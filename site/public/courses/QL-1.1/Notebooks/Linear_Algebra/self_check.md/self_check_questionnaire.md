# Linear Algebra - Vectors & Matrices

## Check your understanding!

1. Describe a vector and a matrix. Try to get beyond just numbers - use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1) resource if you want to dive deeper into what these represent geometrically!

2. What is the difference between scalar multiplication and matrix multiplication? Which one uses "dot product?" Bonus if you can describe a practical scenario in which you would use one over the other!

3. Check yourself! How many rows would the product of this multiplication have? How many columns?

4. What is a *transposition*, or the *transpose* of a given matrix? How do we find it?

5. What are some ways in which vectors and matrices are used in computer science? Why do you think they're important to learn?
