# Calculus - Derivatives & Gradient Descent

## Calculus Fundamentals

1 Blue 3 Brown also has an entire [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x) which explains calculus fundamentals, beginning with derivatives.

### Derivatives

[Derivatives... how?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqF3i1pnyzU) - an MIT grad provides a really great explanation in a slightly different way of the rules to follow when taking a derivative, as well as what a derivative even is and why it's important.
