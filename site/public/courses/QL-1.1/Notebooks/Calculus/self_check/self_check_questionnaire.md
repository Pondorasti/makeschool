# Calculus - Derivatives

## Check Your Understanding!

Let's take some time to check in with ourselves and see how we feel about the main themes of today's lesson. Below are a few questions to check your understanding. Try to answer them on your own first, and then go back to the ones you might not feel so comfortable with. Find some resources, or ask your instructor or a friend and see if you can find the solution together!

1. Estimate the derivative of the following function by hand:

<!-- Aligns with learning outcomes: 2 -->
2. a) Try to compute the partial derivative over y of the following:

    ![Problem 2](2problem.png)

   b) Now, compute the partial derivative over t for the function above! (df/dy)

<!-- Aligns with general concept of lesson -->
3. What is a *derivative*, and why are we learning about them? (Try to explain what, geometrically, this concept is finding or representing).

4. Let's dig deeper into #3!

   a) Graph (by hand) a simple quadratic function such as f(x)= 3x^2 + 2*x + 5 .
      You can get graph paper online, or use something like [this](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/als0wdo8d4)

    b) Compute the derivative at a point, x = -1, by constructing the tangent line and measuring its slope

    c) Compare that answer to the number you get from the formula df/dx = 6*x+2 = 6*(-1)+2 = -4 to verify that you got the correct answer!

<!-- Aligns generally with learning outcomes: 3 -->
4. Write a Python function that estimates the gradient of x^2 at x = -3. Be sure to use the "definition of derivative" formula we went over to *estimate* the derivative!(We should have gotten some good practice with this in class! Try at least pseudocoding it on your own before looking at your notes!)

<!-- Aligns with learning outcomes: 2, provides more exposure to a difficult concept -->
5. Using either the Symbolic package or Tensorflow, calculate the derivative over y of the following in Python:
