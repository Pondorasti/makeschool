## Tabbed Schedule - EXAMPLE

**How to make a tabbed schedule.**

- The code that does this is in comments, so view the raw markdown to see what's going on.
- When you view the Docsify website of the course, the tabs will appear.
- They will NOT appear by just viewing on GitHub

### Instructions

1. Copy the appropriate schedule(s) from the above list with the correct dates
1. View the example below and copy the commented out code to generate the tabs:
    1. `<!-- tabs:start -->` - put at the beginning of where you want tabs
    1. `<!-- omit in toc -->` - put at the beginning of each header within the tabs
    1. `<!-- tabs:end -->` - put at the end of where you want tabs (i.e. at the end of the last schedule)

**See below example**

<!-- tabs:start -->
<!-- omit in toc -->
