## Introduction

Welcome to MOB4. In this class we will be looking at professional backend development in Ruby on Rails.

## Class Structure & Expectations

The format for the class is like this:

Everyone is going to go through the [Voicey Tutorial](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Voicey-Tutorial) on the Online Academy in parallel to class lessons and activities. There will be some time to work through the tutorial in class, but most of the time should be spent outside of class on the tutorial. The tutorial is part of the class, which means you can ask questions on the tutorial in class, and use it as a reference point for your team project.

We will then break up into teams to build an original Ruby on Rails application.

Treat this class as a job! We will be working in teams for most of the class on building a custom project. That means following industry best practices with coding conventions like testing, naming, git structure and sprint planning.
