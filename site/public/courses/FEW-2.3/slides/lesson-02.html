1. Where is state used in the tutorial?
1. What is state? Describe in as much detail as you can
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Props and State

Props are values passed to a component from outside. State is values stored internally by a component. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
A component renders when it receives props or state changes.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Counter Component

Consider this component: 

```JS
import { Component } from 'react'

class Counter extends Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props)

		this.state = { count: 0 }
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div className="Counter">
				<small>{this.props.title}</small>
				<h1>{this.state.count}</h1>
				<button
					onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1})}
				>+</button>
				<button
					onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1})}
				>-</button>
			</div>
		)
	}
}

export default Counter
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
What happens in the Counter component?

- What is state for this component?
  - How many properties does it have?
  - What type is it? 
- What is props for this component?
  - How are props used here? 
- What does this component do?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Impplement this component in your App: 

```JS
import Counter from './Counter'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Counter title="Apples" />
      <Counter title="Oranges" />
      <Counter title="Limes" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Props, State, and rendering components
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
In Reactive programming changing a value cause the program to react to these changes by rendering (redrawing). 

For example, changing props on a component means you called the function that is the component and passed new props. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
In the Counter component the title changes when you pass a new prop value. 

The component also updates the value displayed when the count changes on state. 

The component is able to render again when you change because you are calling a method/function.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
When state changes you aren't changing state directly: 

```JS
// Always change state with setState()
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
```

Here you're calling the setState method. When you do this the component know that it should render again.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Why doesn't this work?

```JS
this.state.count += 1 // Doesn't work!
```

Here the component is unware that render itself when you change a value on state.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You can change multiple values on state at the same time: 

```JS
this.setState({ a: 1, b 22, : 333 })
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Communication between components is best handled by passing values down from parent to child. 

Sometimes you'll want to Pass a value from a child to a parent. The best strategy here is to use a function. Pass a function from the parent and have the child execute that function and pass values as arguments. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lifting State

What is lifting state? THis is the process of moving values from a child component to a parent component.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Consider the counter example. What if you needed to show the total of all Counters? How would you do that?

The easiest way to handle this will be to pass the count down to the counter. The parent component would own and track state. While child component simply displays the value.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The solution is to "lift" state from each of the Counters and store the state in the parent. You can then pass the value of each counter down as a prop to be displayed. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
State in your parent component should be an array of integers: 

```JS
this.state = { count: [0,0,0] }
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
For each value in the array make a counter: 

```JS
this.state.count.map((value, index) => <Counter value={value} index={index} />)
```

Be sure to include the index since each button will need the index to set it's value.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Next you need a method to increment and decrement the count. This will live in the parent component where state is defined. 

```JS
increment(index) {
  // copy state since its a reference
  const newCount = [...this.state.count]
  // Increment the value at index
  newCount[index] += 1
  // Update state 
  this.setState({ count: newCount })
}
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You write a decrement method in your parent component: 

```JS 
decrement(index) {
  ???
}
```

This method should subtract 1 from the value of count at the index. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The last step is to pass the increment and decrement methods to your Counter component and call the methods when the buttons are clicked. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Methods called from another object will lose their reference to `this`. 

The same is true when you use arrow functions.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
This happens when you pass a function to a component through props: 



```JS
class Counter extends Component {

  increment(index) {
    ...
  }

  render() {
    return <Counter increment={this.increment} />
  }
}
```

This has a problem! `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.state')`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Solution 1: bind this with 

```js
<Counter increment={ this.increment.bind(this) } />
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Solution 2: Wrap the function call in a function: 

```JS
<Counter increment={ index => this.decrement(index) } />
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Technical Debt

Often while working on software projects the solutions you create are not the best. You won't even know it until later on. This is [Technical Debt](https://www.agilealliance.org/introduction-to-the-technical-debt-concept/).

You've probably incurred some technical debt on this project, let's pay it back. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Linting

A linter is a tool that analyzes your code and flags errors, bad style, and suspicious constructs. 

Besides finding bugs the linter ensures consistency in your code. Doing things consistently creates the best quality code that runs reliably. Consistency is also important for working on teams. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Linting is a professional best practice.** All of the best companies use linters, you should too! 

Using a linter will: 

- Make your code read well
- Find Errors
- Improve the quality of your code
- Teach you professional best practice
- Teach you more about code and syntax
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Seriously, using a linter is a great way to learn more about the code you are writing. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Install ESLint

For our project, we will be using ESLint. This is a linter that works with all of the major code editors. 

You'll need to install it _in your editor_ and _in your project_. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Install ESLint in your code Editor**

This varies with the editor. Generally speaking, ESLint is a plugin or package you will add. Follow these steps to install ESLint in Visual Studio Code and Atom. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- Atom: 
 - Packages > Settings View > Manage Packages 
 - + Install
 - Search for ESLint `linter-eslint`
 - Install 
- Visual Studio Code: 
 - Code > Preferences > Extensions
 - Search for ESLint
 - Install
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Initialize ESLint**

ESLint is installed as part of the create react app project. You can use it by initializing it. 

Initialize ESLint: 

`eslint --init` 

Answer with these: 

- To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style
- JavaScript modules (import/export)
- React
- TypeScript: No
- Browser
- Use a popular style guide
- Airbnb: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
- JavaScript
- Would you like to install them now with npm? Yes
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
