			- What is React?
				- Library for making user interfaces
				- It's built on Functional Reactive programming concepts
					- **Functional programming** is programming with functions. It avoids changhing state and mutable data. There are many concepts: Pure functions, monads, and functors. We will cover some examples of functional programming in class. You don't have to be an expert to use React. 
					- **Reactive Programming** is programming with data streams. A reactive program reacts to changes in a system rather than following instructions.
