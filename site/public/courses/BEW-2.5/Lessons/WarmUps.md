## [**45m**] ☀️ Warm Up 1: Keyboard Input & Variables

1. 📚 Read **[Keyboard Input](https://golangr.com/keyboard-input/#Keyboard-input-in-golang)**. **Take notes on how to read from `stdin`**.
1. 📚 Read **[Variables](https://golangr.com/variables/)** and **review what you learned in the tutorial**.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>📹 If you prefer to **watch a video**, scroll down to the **bottom of the page**.
1. ✅ **Complete the following exercises**, using what you learned above as a guide:
   - [ ] Write a program that **calculates the year** using a provided **date of birth and age**. **HINT**: Get the date of birth and age from `stdin`!
   - [ ] Write a program that **calculates the average weight of 5 people**.
1. **Paste the code for each solution in the [Warm Up 1: Keyboard Input & Variables](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/133578/assignments/533966) worksheet on Gradescope.**
1. At the end of the warm up, **submit whatever you have complete!**
   1. If you finish early, take a break until class starts.
   1. It's okay if you didn't finish! You'll still earn credit for participating.

## [**30m**] ☀️ Warm Up 2: Structs & While Loops

1. 📚 Read [Structs](https://golangr.com/struct/).
1. 📚 Read [While Loops](https://golangr.com/while/).
1. ✅ **Write a program that solves the problem below**, using what you learned above as a guide:
   - [ ] Declares a public `struct` that represents a house.
   - [ ] The struct should contain variables `numberOfRooms`, `city`,  `address`, and `price`, each assigned their appropriate data type (string, int, etc)
   - [ ] When your program runs, allow users to enter information for one to many houses.
   - [ ] After the user submits all their information, print a list of the houses for sale in the following format:

      ```bash
      123 Address Road   San Francisco   8 Rooms   $123,456
      456 Another Ln     Pittsburgh      4 Rooms   $90,000
      ```

1. At the end of the warm up, **submit whatever you have complete!**
   1. If you finish early, take a break until class starts.
