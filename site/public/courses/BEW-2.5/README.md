## Course Description

_In this course, students discover the value of strongly typed languages in server-side architectures, and dive deep into performant, concurrent programming paradigms present in Go. In studying Go, which is known for its ability to blend the expressive features of dynamic languages (Python, JavaScript) with the performance capabilities of compiled languages (C, C++), students will gain the syntactic diversity required in today's large-scale platform engineering pursuits. Throughout the course, students will learn and implement the design patterns and best practices that make Go a top choice at high-velocity startups like Lyft, Heroku, Docker, and Medium._

## Prerequisites

## Course Deliverables

We will be using Gradescope this term, which allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope. As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at https://gradescope.com/reset_password. The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

*Assignments **must** be submitted to Gradescope by **11:59PM PST** on the date due.*
