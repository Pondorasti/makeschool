## Class Assignments

1. [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/209338)

All assigned work will be submitted through Gradescope, and assignment and exam grades will be returned through Gradescope.

As soon as grades are posted, you will be notified immediately so that you can log in and see your feedback. You may also submit regrade requests if you feel we have made a mistake.

Your Gradescope login is your Make School email, and your password can be changed at [https://gradescope.com/reset_password](https://gradescope.com/reset_password). The same link can be used if you need to set your password for the first time.

2. [Blog Post Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a1zEGK7aI7XF5WCA--KaOXYAeZvBRuCBZ6Da2RHwjW8/edit#gid=0)

Complete your blog posts and post one comment by the end of class time on Thursday (1.45pm, PST).

Update your url links to your blog posts and comment on the **blog post tracker**(where your classmates can access your blog posts to comment on them) and on **Gradescope** (where I can grade them). Please be careful while updating your links on the tracker as to not move/edit/change your other classmates' entry.

We will use Medium to write the blog posts. Here is the blog posts [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/188wuJkFN1PYo4NWnn-rP-Z6uHIF5HT2NHS9fY1GqXpw/edit).

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required  assignments and blog posts tasks
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences
- Late Assignments must be agreed between you and I via Slack/email **3 days** before the due date

**[Code of Conduct, Equity, and Inclusion](https://make.sc/code-of-conduct)**

Make School nurtures attitudes and behaviors that promote global awareness, inclusivity, and respect for the dignity of each person regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, culture, political conviction, religion, or disability. We are committed to creating an environment in which every individual can work, study, and live without feeling excluded, unsafe, or harassed.

During classrooms discussions, you may encounter opposing and different views with your classmates, and that is totally fine. In fact, I welcome a diverse array of opinions. Part of a healthy discussion is being able to discuss those differences clearly and respectfully. Sometimes, you may think your classmates' questions are “stupid,” but they deserve the same level of respect from you as you wish from them. You can expect me to be fair, and I will not tolerate any hate speech (e.g. any attacks on another person's identity, background, life experiences) in class. If the need arises, I will respectfully ask you to leave the discussion/zoom room.

Make School’s desire to foster a professional environment that honors the freedom of expression is equally balanced with pursuit to create an inclusive living and learning environment.
