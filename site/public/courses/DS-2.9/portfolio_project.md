# Portfolio Project

## Description
The goal of this DS-2.9 Technical Seminar is for each student to produce their own in-depth, Data Science Portfolio Project.


## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able to…

1. Research and analyze an industry-relevant topic in Data Science
1. Master the use of state-of-the art python libraries for data exploration, manipulation, visualization, machine learning and/or deep learning, model validation, and hyperparameter tuning
1. Build a solo portfolio project in an industry-relevant area that combines skills learned throughout the data science curriculum
1. Engage in technical discussions around their project and those of their classmates
1. Demonstrate their understanding of their project by competing a thorough writeup


## Schedule

You will have 6 weeks to complete this project.  
Your work will be organized according to the following schedule

- Classes 1 - 3: Research topics of interest, identify a suitable project
- Classes 4 - 6: Data Exploration, Visualization and Pre-processing
- Classes 7 - 8: Modeling and Validation  
  - Select a few appropriate models  
  - Train and evaluate the models
  - Compare results and select the Final (best) Model
- Classes 9 - 10: Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Carry out cross-validation experiments to tune the Final Model hyperparameters
- Class 11:  
  - Evaluate the Final Model on the test data  
  - Optionally complete model interpretability experiments
- Class 12: Complete the project code and writeup
- Class 13: Present your project in class


## Deliverables and Deadlines

- **Milestone 1: Research and Writeup - Due Day 3 @ 11:00pm**  
    - Instructor will approve projects by the start of class on Day 4
- **Milestone 2: Project Proposal - Due Day 4 @ 11:00pm**  
    - Public GitHub Repository Link
    - README.md in the repo with proposal writeup complete. The README.md file will eventually contain the writeup of your project  
- **Milestone 3: Data Exploration, Visualization, Preprocessing - Due on Day 6 @ 11:00pm**
    - Colab notebook with code and README file with writeup, complete through the Data Exploration, Visualization, Preprocessing phase
- **Milestone 4: Modeling and Validation - Due on Day 8 @ 11:00pm**
    - Colab notebook with code and README file with writeup, complete through the Modeling and Validation phase
- **Milestone 5: Hyperparameter Tuning - Due on Day 10 @ 11:00pm**
    - Colab notebook with code and README file with writeup, complete through the Hyperparameter Tuning phase
- **Milestone 6: Final Code and Writeup - Due on Day 12 @ 11:00pm**  
    - Final Colab notebook with completed code and Final README file with completed writeup
- **Milestone 7: Presentation - Due on Day 13 in class**
    - Oral presentation delivered to the class


## Requirements
TBD -- List out requirements for the project here

1. Requirement 1
1. Requirement 2
1. Requirement 3

## Stretch Requirements/Challenges (Optional)
Carry out model interpretability experiments, complete the code and writeup the results in the README file


## Rubric
TBD -- Link to project rubric placed here

## Commit Requirements

All projects will require a minimum of 65 commits, with a minimum of 10 commits per week throughout the entirety of the course

- Good Example: 100+ commits throughout the length of the project, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- Bad Example: 15 commits on each of five days during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- Unacceptable Example:20 commits all in the week before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

## Explanation of the "continuous commits" strategy
We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer.  
Breaking up a project by doing many frequent commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for a more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset.  
Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.
