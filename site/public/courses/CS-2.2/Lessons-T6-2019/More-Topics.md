## Topological Sorting and Scheduling


### Why you should know this...
Scheduling problems arise often in computer science and elsewhere, including instruction scheduling, logic synthesis, determining the order of completion tasks to perform, data serialization, and more.  Topological sorting produces a linear ordering of the vertices that represents the solution.


### Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Model scheduling problems as topological sorting.

1. Use Directed Acyclic Graphs to model and solve problems.


## Graph Coloring & Covering

## Why you should know this...
Problems of resource allocation such as scheduling, network distribution, data mining, image capturing can be solved using graph coloring techniques which separate the graph into smaller components or subgraphs.  


### Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Apply graph coloring algorithms to find or bound the chromatic number of a graph
1. Model problems with graph coloring.
1. Explore common graph algorithms utilizing subgraphs.



### Overview 1: Coloring and Covering
- **Graph coloring** is a simple way of labelling graph components such as vertices, edges, and regions under some constraints.

- The **chromatic number** of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to properly color a graph so that no two adjacent vertices, adjacent edges, or adjacent regions are colored the same.
