# Quiz 3: Dynamic Programming & NP-Hard Problems

## Dynamic Programming

- Given a recurrence relation, draw a graph of the recursive call stack.
- Fill in a DP table for any of the 3 problems we've seen in class: 1) Longest Common Substring, 2) Knapsack, 3) Edit Distance.
- Describe the recurrence relation for any of the above problems.
- Describe the purpose of memoization; explain the differences between memoization & DP table

## NP-Hard Problems

- Describe what it means for a problem to be NP-Hard
- Describe what is a heuristic and how are they useful
- Describe the "naive solution" for a given NP-Hard problem
