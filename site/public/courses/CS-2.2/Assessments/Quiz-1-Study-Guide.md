# Quiz 1: Graph Properties and Traversals

Graph properties:

- Given a problem (e.g. find a path from place A to place B), identify the vertices and edges and describe the problem in terms of a graph.
- Compare and contrast directed & undirected graphs
- Compare and contrast connected & disconnected graphs

Graph traversals:

- Implement Breadth-first Search / Traversal on a graph or digraph.
- Implement Recursive Depth-first Search on a graph or digraph.
- Write pseudocode for BFS, Iterative DFS or Recursive DFS.
- Model solutions to applications using BFS or DFS, such as:
  - How should I get home? (Shortest path with BFS)
  - Is there a way to send data to all the computers on the network? (Connected graph with DFS)
