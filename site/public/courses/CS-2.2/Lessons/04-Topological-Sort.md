### [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OKrGMviXcOSTGujs1ZNOemUHegLOcLlJUHEy0G6SdkY/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you should be able to...

1. Explain how topological sort can be used to solve real-world problems.
1. Implement topological sort using Kahn’s Algorithm and Depth-first Search.
1. Complete graph applications problems by identifying nodes & vertices.

## Course Scheduling Activity (15 minutes)

With a group of 3, fill out [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8di9nzsR3Pv32VULs9qhmMZ_GwcF1f8gf_zh5_LDqM/edit?usp=sharing) (parts 1 and 2) to find a course schedule for the 2 schools.

## Activity 2 (15 minutes)

With a group of 3, perform a topological sort for the graph on [this Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1dvv2ckWWwFzhB9t2JOuJwPNi9mhTzHl-TOm3ta2o1yM/edit?usp=sharing). Use either Kahn’s Algorithm or Depth-first Search.

## BREAK

## Pair Programming Activity (30 minutes)

With a group of 3, choose who will be the driver, the navigator, and the observer.

- Driver: Share your screen & type in code according to the navigator’s instructions
- Navigator: Decide what to do next & how to solve the problem
- Observer: Give feedback and help your group if they are stuck!

Write pseudocode and then real code for 1-2 of the following problems:

[Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) - BFS or DFS
[Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/) - BFS
[Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/) - BFS
[Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/) - Topological Sort
