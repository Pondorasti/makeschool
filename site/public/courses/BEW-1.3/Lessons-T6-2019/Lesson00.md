## Welcome

**_Welcome to BEW 1.3!_**

Class is like a job; think of this as a work environment rather than a traditional class. On the job, you work in a team. Team members assist one another, keeping in mind the end goal: to produce the **best work possible as a team**.

As team members you are **not in competition**; instead, your goal is to **support each other** both in class and in completing your project.

## Work

**It is your job to schedule time and complete the work assigned to you.**

You'll be working on several projects over the course of 7 weeks.

First, you'll work on a tutorial project: a clone of Reddit built in Node and Express.

Once you've completed the tutorial, you'll define and complete a custom project for yourself. This custom project will be your own idea built from the material, ideas, and inspiration experienced in class and on campus at Make School.
