# Full Stack 2 Custom Project Spec

## Objectives

1. Build an original multi-resource website yourself.

## Requirements

1. Begin from scratch without any sort of template. You may look at any code you like, 
and copy and paste chunks of other code, but do not duplicate an entire other project.
1. Useful RESTful routing.
1. Your site serves at least three resources. 
1. The project must be shipped live on heroku.
1. Stretch Goals
  1. A full test suite of controller tests for your routes.
  1. A fully responsive, conventionally styled, front end using Bootstrap 3.

## Code Review

You must have your site code reviewed by the instructor. This means you'll need
to get your project finished before the last day of class! 

Turn your work in as early as possible to get a code review. This will give time 
to act on that advice. 

## Options

1. You may use any API you like to integrate into your project.
1. You may work alone or in pairs - if you are going to work in pairs you must 
pair program for 90% of the time - this will mean significant coordination outside 
of class to schedule time to work side-by-side. You will be expected to turn in 
the project together. Pair programed projects are not expected to be more 
feature-full (because pp can be slower than solo programming sometimes), but they 
are expected to demonstrate significantly better code craftsmanship.
1. You may add another resource if you like and look ahead to how to do reference 
and embedded documents.

## Preparation 

The first step to create your project is to decide on the project. Choose a
subject, something simple that you know you can complete. It's better to 
create simple project that you can build on in the future than to try and 
create an overly ambitious project that you may not finish by the end of the 
term. 

Follow these steps

1. Define the project and limit the scope. 
1. Define the resources the project will work with. 
1. Define your routes using RESTful principals. 
1. Build your project. 

### Define your resources

Define your resources. You should have three. 

A resource can be anything your web site manages. Here are a couple examples. 

Reddit 

1. User 2. Post 3. Comment

Photos app like instagram

1. User 2. Photo 3. Comment

Trip planner

1. Trip 2. User 4. Event

Multiplayer game

1. User 2. Game  3. Group


### Define your routes 

Define the routes you will use to create your project. Fill out the table 
with the routes you will use to serve the resources you defined above. 

| # |Action|HTTP verb|Path|Returns|
|---|------|---------|----|-------|
| 1 |      |         |    |       |
| 2 |      |         |    |       |
| 3 |      |         |    |       |

## Submission

1. Send two links (github and heroku) to your instructor before the final day of class.
