## Learning Objectives (5 minutes)

By the end of this class, you should be able to...

1. Read and review a partner's documentation site.
1. Use the documentation for an API to write route tests.
1. Write route code based on unit tests to make the tests pass.

## Activity Part 1: Write Tests based on Documentation (40 minutes)

Pair up with another student; you will be _pair programming_ for the duration of this activity. Decide who will be **Partner A** and who will be **Partner B**.

- If you are **Partner A**, you will write _route tests_ for the **endpoints of Partner B's API**. Use Partner B's **API documentation site** to guide you, and try to write at least 4 tests. 
- If you are **Partner B**, you will act as the _navigator_ and guide your partner through writing the tests.

After 20 minutes, switch partners. Make sure to send your partner the test code you wrote.

Your instructor will periodically check on you. _Make sure one partner is sharing their screen at all times during the activity!_

If you need an example of Node route tests, check out the [User endpoint tests](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/chai-testing-challenges/blob/master/src/test/user.js) from our previous assignment.

## BREAK (10 minutes)

## Activity Part 2: Make the Tests Pass (40 minutes)

Using your partner's test code from Part 1, write route code for your API to make your tests pass. Your partner will act as the _navigator_ and will help to unblock you.

After 20 minutes, switch partners.

## Wrap-Up

API project Phase 2 is due 1 week from today. Please review the [API Project Spec](Projects/02-Custom-API-Project.md) and familiarize yourself with the requirements.
