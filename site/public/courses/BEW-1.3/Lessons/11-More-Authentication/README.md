# More Authentication

## Agenda

1. Warm-Up: JWT Tokens
1. Password Salting & Hashing
1. BREAK
1. Activity: JWT Authentication Tutorial
1. Final Project Work Time

## Learning Objectives

1. Use JWT tokens to verify that a user is logged in when making a request
1. Write tests for routes using authenticated user
1. Work on final project and resolve any blockers

## Warm-Up: JWT Tokens

On your own, answer the following questions (feel free to reference the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)):

**_What are JWT tokens? What is the difference between `jwt.sign()`, `jwt.decode()`, and `jwt.verify()`? How do we use them?_**

Then, share with a partner.

## Password Salting & Hashing Jigsaw (40 minutes)

### Expert Groups (20 minutes)

Form groups of 2. With your partner, read **_one of_** the following articles:

1. [Password Hashing](https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-passwords-one-way-road-to-security/)
1. [Password Salting](https://auth0.com/blog/adding-salt-to-hashing-a-better-way-to-store-passwords/)

As you read, take notes and answer the following questions:

1. What is password hashing/salting?
1. Why is it important for website security?
1. How do we do it in our Node/Express project?

### Jigsaw Groups (20 minutes)

Pair with another group and discuss both concepts. How do they fit together?

As a class, discuss how these were used in the Reddit.js project.
