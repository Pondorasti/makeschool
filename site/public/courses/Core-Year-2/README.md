# Core-Year-2

The Core curriculum of the Product College consists of a blend of technical and general skills that all software engineers and employees must master to be successful in their careers. During the second year, core includes classroom, lab, and coaching time.

* **CORE 6 (Term 1): Work/Life Balance** -
Graduates from the Product Colleg are not just good at work, they are good at work and life, and work-life balance. In this term, we will be focusing our learnings on how to manage one’s personal finances, wellness, and explore and discuss what habits make for a healthy and fulfilling life.

* **CORE 7 (Term 2): Advanced Networking** - 
Networking is an art and a technology. We’ll take our networking skills to the next level by reading and discussing the business classic Never Eat Alone while roleplaying networking experiences and getting feedback from real mentors and networking events in the field. Bring your business cards and your fancy boots.

* **CORE 8 (Term 3): Large Team Project & Leadership Skills** - 
Students team up again to work on an ambitious project of their choice. This time, deep instruction is given to help students master interpersonal dynamics including: leading teams, managing up, conflict resolution, and advocating for your ideas. Their ambitious project will be a significant addition to their portfolio.

    As you work in a big team, you will be taking on the topic of how to lead and how to follow, how to manage and how to be managed. We will be role playing, discussing, and reading the leading and classical books and articles on the topic. Whether you never want a job as a manager, or you want to climb the corporate ladder, you’ll still want to know how teams work and how to make them great.

* **CORE 9 (Term 4): Ramp Camp & Professional Success Skills** -
When you start at a new dev job, there is a time between when you join and when you can make valuable contributions to the code base – this is called “Ramping”. Really great companies will put new devs through a Ramp Camp where you learn the systems and the code base of their company. In this term we’ll spend our time familiarizing ourselves with the architectures and common tools that large code bases use to operate. This includes topics such as: Continuous integration with Travis CI, Code Reviews, server admin, and Docker (conceptually understand containers).

* **CORE 10 (Term 5): Job Search** -
This is what you’ve been working toward for almost two years! Now it’s time to focus on your job hunt and spend extra time to search, apply, and practice interviewing and solving problems for technical interviews.
