# Advanced Networking and Email Skills & UI/UX Design

Networking is an art and a technology. We’ll take our networking skills to the next level by reading and discussing the business classics Never Eat Alone and How to Win Friends and Influence People while roleplaying networking experiences and getting feedback from real mentors and networking events in the field. Bring your business cards and your fancy boots.

You'll also get hands on experience with advanced communication challenges. We'll roleplay various communication scenarios including: followup or thank you emails, responding to aggressive messages or apologize for a mistake, geting an unresponsive person to respond, reviving an old contact, declining pointless meetings, reducing back and forth, negotiating, delegating tasks to team, asking to meet with investor, cold emailing a stranger for advice.

This class cultivates ability to grow your personal network. You’ll have more exposure - and structured help - to connect with Make School’s network of industry professionals, partner companies. These individuals can become mentors, potential employers, cofounders, friends and partners.

By the end, you’ll have the interpersonal skills to be comfortable and confident in your next job.

### Baseline Challenges
1. Get coffee with 2-3 industry professionals
1. Get 10 business cards from an industry meet up of your choice
1. Create skits on proper and inproper behavior at networking events
1. Do an act of "Rejection Therapy": something you and others could benefit from despite a (high) possibility of failure.
1. Entrepreneur/CTO Interview - you will interview a successful entreprenuer or CTO and prepare a ~2 page report on what factors made them successful. This is a great chance for you to practice your networking and learn career success skills while accomplishing the assignment.
1. Facilitate a book discussion on your assigned day. Facilitation involves three components, 1) thinking up 3-4 questions that: relate book content to participant's experiences, speak to the nuance and paradoxes of the book material, and dig into how to take the book's principles into practice; 2) Submit the questions to Dan at least and hour before class; 3) facilitate the 20 min discussion to ensure full participation, active engagement, and that diverse and contrasting views are voiced.

### Stretch Challenges
1. Connect with the head of a meetup group and ask them who would be a good fit for you to connect with given your skills
1. Connect for coffee with an engineer at your dream company
1. Network your way to grab coffee with an exectutive (CTO, Engineering Lead, etc) at a company
