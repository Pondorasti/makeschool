# Work Life Balance

### Intro (optional)

Graduates from the Product College are not just good at work, they are good at work and life, and work-life balance. In this term, we will be focusing our learnings on how to manage one’s wellness, and explore and discuss what habits make for a healthy and fulfilling life.

The course is a combination of small group discussion and best practices. Small groups of 4-5 students will reflect on what habits they want to adopt, and their methodologies. Students can trouble shoot blockers and offer suggestions for more effective strategies. These function as a "support group" of peers to make change in their life.

Instructors will also lecture on the science-based best practices for diet, exercise, sleep & relaxation, and relationships. These lectures will supplement the student's thinking on how to manage their own work life balance.

Class will culminate with each student giving a presentations on how they've changed, what they've learned and their strategy for what new habits they may want to adopt in the coming year.
