# ARCHIVE - MOB6 - 2D Game Development

## NOTE: This repo is no longer maintained

## Course Overview

Building 2d games with SpriteKit and Swift. Students will create their own games
using fundamental concepts of game creation like sprites, cartesian coordinate
systems, Actions, 2d physics, and more!

Students will study game design, level design, and game balance.

Students will look at color and design in games.

## Objectives

1. Students will work with SpriteKit, Swift, and Xcode.
1. Level design
1. Designing game assets
1. Planning game balance for quality game play
1. Look at patterns like Entity component structure and State machines

## Competencies

1. Build games using Xcode, SpriteKit and Swift.
1. Design levels for games that they conceive.
1. Identify various tradeoffs of each architecture and select best fit for game.
1. Design games with interesting and engaging game play through careful game balance.

## Vocabulary

- Sprites
- Scenes
- Physics body
- SKActions
- Mechanics
- Collisions
- Coordinates

## Projects

Class will cover two (2) tutorials and one custom game project. Each of the
two tutorials should be completed each week for the first two
weeks of class.

Students present their completed tutorials each week in class.

The custom project will be presented in stages across the three final weeks
of class.
