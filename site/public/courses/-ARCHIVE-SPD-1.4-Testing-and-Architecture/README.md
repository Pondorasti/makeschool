# [ARCHIVED 2020] SPD 1.4 Testing and Architecture

## Course Description

This course focuses on advanced topics in testing and code craftsmanship. Students apply these concepts to existing portfolio projects, adding a further layer of sophistication. Topics covered include: types of testing, automated testing, design patterns, open source coding, and navigating massive codebases. The course also covers guiding principles in software development that help professional developers make decisions on what language, frameworks, and construction practices to use while building projects. By the end of the course, students will have refactored projects to have better testing and architecture, and built an additional solo project incorporating course principles.

## Prerequisites

- [SPD 1.3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/SPD-1.3-Team-Software-Project)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Compare and contrast software construction options and make informed decisions around which to pick.
1. Produce elegant pseudocode to quickly describe how to solve a problem.
1. Practice techniques to improve the quality and craftsmanship of their software.
1. Design and implement code refactors.
1. Apply debugging and testing best practices to more easily resolve bugs.
