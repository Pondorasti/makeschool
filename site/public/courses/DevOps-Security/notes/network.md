Network

Switches connect devices on the same netowrk
Routers connect devices on different networks

Switches connect devices 
Routers Connect networks


Two addresses

MAC - Media Access Control
IP - Internet Protocol

MAC Addressed are *burned* into the NIC (network interface card) this is 
where all network communication enters and exits the machine.

MAC Addresses are 12 character long the first 6 are the manufacturer id. 
The last 6 are the Device ID. 

000ACD2D4077

MAC Addresses are globally unique

IPv4 Addresses 
- logical address
- bound to software
- 32bits
- Four base 10 decimal numbers 

Contain 2 sections

192.168.1.52

192.168.1 <= network ID .52 <= host id

Network ID nodes on the same network share this
Host id unique to each host on a shared network

Subnet mask 32 bit value divides network and host bits

When the source address is OR'ed || with ...


ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
All devices see the arp request and read it
Only the host device the message is meant for replies only to the 
broadcaster of the message which had inlcuded it's MAC address so 
the host device only replies to that device. 

Broadcasts on networks are bad. Every device must listen. 


Direction communication is only possible between devices on the 
same network
