# iOS104 - End-to-End iOS Development

## Course Overview

In this course, we will be developing an iOS app but first building our own small API to interface with! Through the course, we will focus on a small core subset of features that will help you be come a successful iOS developer.

Knowing the complete cycle of developing backend systems and client interfaces is crucial to building any internet product or service.

It also helps you understand how these systems are built from the ground up and how to get your own software service up and running!

We will split the classes up between the backend(Phoenix/Elixir) and the frontend(iOS).

For the backend, we will build a small Phoenix app with a postgres database. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with any of those. This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of the language (Elixir) and the framework (Phoenix).

## Objectives & Competencies

1. Learn how the request response cycle works
2. Build a two resource API
3. Interface with the API with an iOS client to fetch and display data.
4. Learn the basics of functional programming.

## Group Project

Work together is groups of 2 to build an API.
Projects must include:

1. At least two(2) RESTful resources/routes.
2. A postgres/sql/mongo database
3. A simple iOS app utilizing the API and displaying results on an iOS app.
