# React Router

React Router is a package that adds routing support to React. 

Routing is the ability to navigate between different areas of 
content. This is handled by showing components. Where each 
component represents a screen/page of content. 

React Router supports both Web and Native. 

## Getting started 

It's hard to beat the the [guide](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/quick-start). 
But I'll try and add a few notes here. 

You'll need to import the libraries. There are several provided. 
Which you import depend on what features you will use. Follow the 
[guide](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) on GitHub.

For web projects import react-router-dom

`npm install --save react-router-dom`

### React Router Dom Components

- `Link` - Naivgates to routes 
- `BrowserRouter` - Manages navigation
- `Route` - Displays a component for a given route
