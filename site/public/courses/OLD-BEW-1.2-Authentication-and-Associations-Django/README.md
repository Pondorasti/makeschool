## Late Assignment Policy

If you submit an assignment after the due date, your instructor will apply a late penalty as follows:

- Late assignments that are submitted **no later that 2 days (48 hours)** after the deadline will be given a **10% late penalty**.
- Another **10% late penalty** will be applied for **every 2 days (48 hours)** that pass after the deadline. For example, an assignment that is submitted 5 days late will receive a 30% late penalty.
- Assignments submitted **more than 7 days (1 week) late** will **not** be accepted.

Late assignment penalties **do not apply** to resubmissions. You may redo and resubmit your old assignments as many times as you would like up to the final course deadline. _**In other words, I will only consider your first submission when applying a late penalty.**_
