1. Solve `v1` `makewiki` challenges and stretch challenges (continued).
2. Illustrate and walk through `v1` solution code.

## [**05m**] ➡️ Agenda & Introduction

> ⚠️ **NOTE**: Complete **ALL** challenges in **ALL** files before moving on to stretch challenges.
>
> Your grade is determined based on **completion of the challenges only**.

Today's class focuses on continuing to implement the [core challenges](https://make.sc/makewiki#step-4-solve-the-challenges) in the [`makewiki`](https://make.sc/makewiki) project.

We'll then review the solution at the end of the class period.

## [**20m**] ✓ Review: Tutorial + Q&A

Review both the [Models Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial02) and [Views & Templates Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial03/).

Provide time for students to ask follow-up questions.

## [**50m**] 💻 Activity

Continue working on your `v1` solution for the `makewiki` project.

## [**10m**] 🌴 BREAK

## [**30m**] ✓ Review: v1 Challenges - Personal Wiki

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Ask students to close their laptops

Go over the solutions to each challenge in the following order:

1. `makewiki/urls.py`
2. `wiki/views.py`
3. `wiki/urls.py`
4. `templates/base.html`

**TIP**: For some solutions, ask a student to the front of the class and type out their solution for each challenge.

## 🌃 After Class

**REMINDER**: `v1` is due next class period!
