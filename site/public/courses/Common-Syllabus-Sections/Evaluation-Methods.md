# Evaluation Methods

The following evaluation process and all rubrics addressing CLOs and Key Projects describe current process at Make School. Current and additional rubrics and processes for scoring and calibrating them will be under development, supported by Dominican’s assessment expertise.  

A student’s mastery of course learning objectives and their overall professional performance will be evaluated using three assessments:

Summative Assessment (Pass/Fail) - Students must earn a passing grade (above 80%) on a summative assessment (final exam) for this course. These assessments model the questions present in technical discussion interviews, technical publications, and technical strategy and planning meetings.

Tutorial Project Completion (Pass/Fail) - Tutorial projects are designed to convey and assess various specific learning objectives. Completing a tutorial demonstrates the learning of of that tutorial’s learning objectives. Tutorial projects are assessed for completion.

Original Project - Original portfolio projects will be evaluated for completion based on the project’s requirements and the Portfolio Project Rubric. 

Professional Participation - A student’s participation is seen as indicative of their professional development. Student participation is assessed during class time, huddles, programming lab, and working with industry contacts. Using the Make School Professional Performance Rubric students must earn at least of a score of “2: Initial Mastery” or greater in all categories in the rubric to pass this course.
