## Course Evaluations

Make School is committed to an ongoing evaluation of its programs and courses through a culture of constructive dialogue and feedback. It is expected that students will  complete the course evaluation either in class or outside of class. A link to the course evaluation will be sent to all the students enrolled in the class by the instructor or student experience lead. 

## Title IX

As instructors, one of our responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for our students and for the campus as a whole. As part of our commitment to students' wellbeing, we have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship violence, or stalking to our Student Experience Lead, so they can inform students about their reporting options and the various support resources available.  Student privacy is a priority for us and will be maintained to the extent permissible by law and policy. For more information about your rights and reporting options, including confidential and anonymous reporting, please reference the Dominican University of California Sexual Misconduct, Harassment, Discrimination & Retaliation Policy at dominican.edu/titleix.
