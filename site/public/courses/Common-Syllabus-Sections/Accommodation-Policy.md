# Accommodation Policy

Students Who Require Accommodations

Make School is committed to equal access for all students in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Students who feel they may need accommodations based on the impact of a disability should contact the administration as soon as possible to discuss specific accommodations. Please escalate to your instructor and the Student Experience Lead.
