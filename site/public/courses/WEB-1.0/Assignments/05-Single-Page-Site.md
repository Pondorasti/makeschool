# WEB 1.0 - Single Page Site

## Description 

Make your own single page web site. You won't use Bootstrap or other framework. Instead you will write all of the HTML and CSS yourself! 

### Why this assignment?

The best way to learn about CSS is to start applying it on your own projects. Writing CSS on your own is an important step in the process of learning the language. 

This single page format is a common sty;e for creating web pages. It's a good place to start applying your skills.

## Project requirements

You goal is to make a site that has the general layout of the [Conquer Template](https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page196/conquer/). Click the link and then the `Live Demo` buton, and take a look at the demo of the template. 

**This template uses Bootstrap you are going to make your own version of it without Bootstrap.**

This site has a few features: 

- Nav bar at the top - These links should navigate to each of the 5 sections within this page.
- The site is a single HTML page with 5 sections
  - Home - With a full width image and message or title in the center
  - Info - has three cards, each card has
        - Image
        - Text info
        - CTA button
  - Full width image and text
  - Some content and image split 3/2 and/or 1/3
  - Contact form

**Your site must have the same features as outlined above!**

Here are some wireframes images showing the general layout you are shooting for. You'll use flex box for the layout. The images below show wire frmes that describe the general layout you are striving to achieve. 

These images have some notes on where flex is applied and which way the axis and cross axis are.

- [Wireframe Alternating layout](https://make-school-courses.github.io/WEB-1.0-Web-Foundations/Assignments/images/Wireframe-with-alternating-layout.png)

### What content should your site contain? 

The subject and context of this site should be purely informational. Think of the site as mini lightning talk on a subject of your choice. 

Use a topic/subject from your S&L class. For example Geology, Psychology, or Ethics. You can optionaly chose another topic if you like. (Try and get credit from your S&L class for this!)

Plan the content for your site like you might write an essay. The text content doesn't have to be long. 

You must include images. Images appear in any box with x. 

Your navbar should include links that navigate to each of the sections of your site. 

### Starter Code

You may want to use the starter code [here](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/single-page-starter) to begin your single-page site.

### Example Sites 

All of these sites use this type of layout or some derivative. Draw inspiration from these for your work.
