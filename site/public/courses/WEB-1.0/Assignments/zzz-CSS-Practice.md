# Bring The Style - Practice with CSS

## Description
While HTML is what provides the foundation and structure of a website, the CSS is what truly brings it to life and catches the attention and eye of your users!

You'll utilize all the CSS knowledge you learned to take this plain, static, site and add transform it into something as little more enticing!

### Starter Code

**TODO: ADD STARTER CODE**

### Final Project Image

**Your job is to take this:**

**INSERT PICTURE OF RENDERED HTML CODE WITHOUT STYLING**

**And turn it into this:**

**INSERT PICTURE OF RENDERED HTML CODE WITH STYLING**

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able to…

1. Utilize margin and padding appropriately to provide proper spacing
1. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to provide more visual structure and avoid the default left-aligned, single-column design. - **TODO: Give choice or pick one?**
1. Use classes and ids to provide shared and unique styles across elements
1. Use a variety of CSS style properties to add more than the default styles

## Schedule

From the day this project is assigned, you will have **1 week** to complete this project. A sample daily outline is provided to assist you in planning your project.

**Important note:** “Day 01” refers to the first calendar day of the project being assigned, and subsequent days will follow this reference:

- Day 01: Project assigned, read the project spec, ask any clarifying questions you may have, begin designing how you would implement the project (don't actually code yet!)
- Day 03: Have the visual structure laid out using CSS Grid/Flexbox **TODO: update based on above decision**
- Day 05: Create the styles needed to match the final spec image
- Day 06: Confirm your spacing (margins/padding) are correct, and tie all the pieces of the project together. Review the final spec image and compare with your result to see if there are any discrepencies.
- Day 07: Fix any remaining style bugs and submit the project!
    
## Requirements

## Rubric

### **TODO: build out in more specifc detail once we know what the project will look like**

Project will be out of 100 points. **You must get a score of 70 points or more to be considered passing**

- (50 points) Proper use of CSS Grid/Flexbox **TODO: update based on above decision** to match the final design
- (40 points) Correct styling of HTML elements
- (10 points) Correct use of margins/padding

## Commit Requirements
**INSTRUCTOR NOTE:** Change the numbers below to be appropriate for your project

**This project will require a minimum of 5 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the assignment**

- **Good Example:** 5+ commits throughout the length of the project, looking for a healthy spattering of commits (such as 1-2 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 5 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 1 commit the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class. 

### Why are we doing this?
We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for a more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.
