# Final Assessment Study Guide

The final assessment for this course will be **Project Based**, which means you will be asked to complete a short project during the allotted time. For an example of what this may look like, check out the course's [Diagnostic Assessment](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/web-assessment).

This assessment will be **Open Note**, which means you will be able to consult any notes, past projects, online resources, etc. However, you **may not** consult with any other person, either a classmate or otherwise.

In order to successfully complete the assessment, you should be able to use the following skills:

- **HTML & Markup**
  - Use semantic HTML to lay out parts of a web page, using tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.
  - Use inline & block HTML elements to display information, such as `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, etc.
  - Use form elements such as `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, & `<button>` to create an HTML form.

- **CSS Styles**
  - Use CSS properties such as `font-family`, `font-size`, `color`, `background-color`, etc. to style page elements.
  - Use the CSS box model properties of `margin`, `border`, & `padding` to style block elements.

- **Flex Box**
  - Use [Flex Box Properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) such as `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, & `align-items` to lay out elements inside of a container.

- **JavaScript**
  - Use `document.querySelector()` to select an element on the page and change its properties.
  - Use `.addEventListener()` to add an event listener to an element to listen for a certain type of event & respond by calling a function.
  - Create, modify, & access fields in JavaScript objects.
