# FEW 1.2 Class 10

## Phaser Systems 

Libraries are built to solve problems by abstracting solutions into functions and objects that can be used to solve a wider variety of problems. This class will look at that in the context of Phaser 3. 

## Objectives 

- Define what a spritesheet
	- Define what problem a spritesheet is trying to solve
	- Define use casecases for spritesheet
- Use Spritesheets to create animation
	- Solving problems with libraries
	- Using the documentation

## Spritesheets 

Sprite sheets are used in games to create animated graphics. 

Animation can be created in two ways

1. Animation can be created by moving things on the screen. Imagine this as animating or changing the value of numeric properties over time. 
2. Animation can also be created by showing a series of images sequentially. 

Games will use both solutions together! 

The first solution is good when things move, scale, and rotate on the screen. 

The second solution is good when you have an element that needs a very detailed motion. For example, a character talking would require a series of images of their mouth in different shapes, a character swinging a sword etc. 

This second example requires us to show a series of images in sequence quickly like what happens when you watch a film or video. With the difference that we are going to apply it to a small area of the screen rather than the whole screen.

## Creating Sprite Sheets with Phaser 3

Let's look at this section from the tutorial:

Look at the art and look at the code. Discuss what is going on here with a partner.
