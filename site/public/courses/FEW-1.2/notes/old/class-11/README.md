# FEW 1.2 Class 11

## Physics with Phaser

This class will take a closer look at Phasers Physics system. 

## Objectives 

- 

## Physics 

2d physics systems define objects with arbitray 2d geometry that move, collide and interact with other objects and gravity in a way that emulates object in the real world. 

The physics system works by defining an Object called a body. The physics simulation applies physical effects and interactions to all bodies in the simulation resolving collisions and gravity. 

Bodies are assigned to Sprites that represent objects on the screen. These sprites inherit x, y, and rotation values from their physics body. 

Discuss physics and bodies.

- What objects are involved? 
- Why separate Sprites and Physics Bodies? 

## Challenges

- Edit physics properties of bodies
- Refine physics interactions
- Continue working on tutorial project
