# FEW 1.2 - Class 1

## Learn JavaScript

You're hired! Consider this class your job for the next 7 weeks. You'll be responsible for making three games, maintaining and improving the code base for your games, keeping notes and documentation for the code that you produce.

It's your job to put in regular hours working on the code you are responsible for.

You will maintain a GitHub Repo for each project. **You need to commit each time you work on the project. For each session you work you should have at least one commit.** This is a requirement.

## Objectives 

- Use JavaScript to create applications of medium complexity
- Implement arrays, including multi-dimensional arrays
- Define objects with Object Literal notation
- Implement control flow to solve problems

## Getting started

The first game you're repsonsible for is Breakout! It's a classic arcade game. You need to make a web version written in JavaScript. 

Start with a new repo for the project. Create a repo and add the repo link to the class progress tracker. 

You'll be followinfg the tutorial here: 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

There are 10 pages in the tutorial you should have at least one commit for each page/step of the tutorial. 

Q: Why so many commits? 

A: The whole purpose of making commits is to allow you and your team to revisit work prior to a change. Actually your commits should be more ganular than just the 10 steps here! Add a new file make a commit. Update a function make a commit. 

Q: Does this really serve a purpose? 

A: Often not, but in the few cases it's invaluable in helping track down an error. It's industry best practice. It's industry best practice that you should be familiar with. Might as well get in a good practice now. 

### Why do this tutorial?

This tutorial makes an application that has a majority of the JavaScript language features you will have to master to be an expert at JS! Might as well learn them by making a game!

The tutorial contains:

- functions
- variables
- Arrays
- Objects
- loops
- if then statements

Beyond these the game has gigher level concepts that are important to designing software applications. 

- code structure 
- order of operations
- control flow
- off by one errors...

It is essential that you master these features to make a career in Software development. Using these features to solve problems and create solutions is an important skill. This tutorial solves some interesting problems using all of these tools. Trying your best to understand the problems that are being solved in the tutorial will help you at technical job interviews in the future!

## Starting the tutorial

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

Read the introduction and move on to the first page of the tutorial: Create the Canvas and draw on it.

The class will do this together then discuss it. 

## Homework: Breakout with JS

[Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) is a classic arcade game. It's simple and has been ported to almost every platform. Your job is to make the JavaScript version.

Your goal is to build the tutorial [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript)

The tutorial is short and contains completed functional code sample at the end of each section, use this to check your work as you progress. 

Read the tutorial and complete the game. Your tutorial should be functional! The tutorial shows the complete sample code at the end of every section. You can test your process against this as you work. Test your work and play the game!

Study the code and do your best to understand how the code functions and why the game behaves as it does. Look closely at the game, be sure to play. Change some of the values and see how they affect the game.

### Due: Class 2

After completing the tutorial You will be working on challenges based on the tutorial. This is why it is essential that your tutorial is functioning when you come to class 2.
