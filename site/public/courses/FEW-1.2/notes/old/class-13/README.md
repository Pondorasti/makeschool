# FEW 1.2 - Class 13

Present your projects

## Presenting your project

Be prepared to show your work in class. You should be able to explain your solution to the best of your ability.

If you have any problems or errors in your code you should be able to say what where and when the problem ocurred and what you have tried to solve it so far. 

Look at this as an opportunity to practice for a coding interview. 

## Aside: Why? 

Why are we learning all of the Class syntax? React!

React uses ES6 class syntax heavily. React is built from
components, and components are based on and written using 
ther ES6 class syntax. 

While you may or may not consider games to be fun. All of 
the problems you solve in games are very similar to the 
problems you're solving elsewhere. A two dimensional array 
of bricks might really be a graph of productsm matched to 
users as recommendations. 

Solving problems is your job as a software developer. You
should not limit yourself in the types of problems want 
to solve. Instead you should be willing and able to 
solve any problem that comes along. 

Here are a few of the bigger problems you are solving: 

- Managing data
	- Multidimensional arrays 
	- complex objects
- Organizing and structuring code
	- Using Classes 
- Handing events
- Dependancy Injection

These ideas apply to all software development. 

## Lab and Review

Students work in groups to solve problems. Students offer problems they are having, list these on board. 

**Discuss problems and solutions.**

Group/pair students to work together for a 15 to 20 min block of time with the goal of solving one of the problems from the list. 

**Take a break**

Repeat the process again mixing group/pairs.

End class with a review of the problems and solutions that were developed during class. 

## After class 

- Finish up the Oregon Trail Project
- Code review your work with another student
