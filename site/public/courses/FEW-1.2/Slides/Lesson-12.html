## Hosting your React Projects with GitHub Pages

Hosting React projects on GitHub requires a little bit of extra work. React projects need to be built and bundled before they can be published to the web. 

Using the power of GitHub you can publish to a branch and continue to work/edit on your master branch. This workflow mirrors the work flow used by professionals. 

The process can be accomplished with `gh-pages` package. Install it now: 

`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

Edit your `package.json` add the following line at the root level of the JSON  object. 

`"homepage": "http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}",`

**Replace `{username}` with your GitHub user name, and `{repo-name}` with the name of the for this project**

Watch the comma at the end! 

Find the scripts section and add these two lines.

```JSON
"scripts": {
  ...
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

Be aware of the commas! You may need to add a comma on the line before `"predeploy": ...` or add a comma after `"deploy": ...`.

Last, run: 

`npm run deploy`

This should build your React project, compiling your ES6 and JSX into a JS bundle. Then, it creates a gh-pages branch on your GitHub repo and pushes your production code to this branch. 

**Note!** I had an error in the console that read: 

> `Failed to get remote.origin.url (task must either be run in a git repository with a configured origin remote or must be configured with the "repo" option).`

I had to run `xcode-select --install` to fix this. Not sure why, it probably had something to do with a system update. 

**React Router** 

If you are using React Router you must use HashRouter! BrowseRouter will not work with GitHub Pages! 

To make this fix you will probably only have to change a single line of code, most likely in App.js. 

Look for: 

`import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom'`

Change this to:

`import { HashRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom'`

Why is this needed? GitHub's server delivers a "fresh" for each unique router. For example if you're page is: `github.io/user-name/index.html`, and  `index.html` is a real file in your repo GitHub's server finds this and serves it. 

If internally your page generates a route like: `github.io/user-name/index.html/id/42` the GitHub server will look for the file 42 in the id folder, which probably doesn't exist. 

Remember! You are not writing the routes that handle requests. 

Why does HashRouter work? By inserting a hash the params you're adding to a route become part of the hash which doesn't change the file GitHub is serving. 

`github.io/user-name/index.html#/id/42`

Hashes are used to navigate internally! So: 

`github.io/user-name/index.html#contact` would navigate to the element with the `id="contact"` within the smae page.
