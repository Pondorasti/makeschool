# Institutional Planning Process

*Staff area owner and author: Ashu Desai (Founder)*

Make School’s approach to institutional planning is designed to allow for rapid iteration and innovation, while keeping all work aligned with the long term mission and vision. We operate on a principle of distributed ownership where all faculty and staff own their roles with certain responsibilities and authorities (**see Governance**); and, are expected to innovate within the scope of their roles. This allows us to set ambitious goals and empower high caliber talent to leverage their unique talents and ideas. We publish the bulk of our institutional plan publicly, visible to staff, students, and prospective students. Our institutional planning encompasses four overlapping processes:

### Institutional Planning:

The following Institutional Planning processes and products were developed by the faculty and leadership of the program during its operation by Make Education Services and were approved by their Board. These are in the process of being reviewed for approval by the Board of Make School.

**Mission and Vision:**

Once every 2-3 years, Make School’s Board of Trustees re-evaluates the mission and vision of the organization to establish long term direction. The process involves students, faculty, staff, and leadership input through visioning exercises. Make School’s Board synthesizes the ideas from various stakeholders and proposes an update for feedback prior to ratifying necessary changes.

**Strategic Plan:**

Once every 2 years, the Senior Leadership Team evaluates a set of mid-term (3-5 year) objectives with input from faculty and team members, Student Council, and the Board of Trustees. These objectives are prioritized and synthesized into a Strategic Plan (**Attachment 9.2 Strategic Plan) **informing growth targets and other strategic priorities.

The Strategic Plan proposes continued distance education alongside campus-based delivery post-pandemic which will require WSCUC approval for an online delivery modality.

**Operating Plan:**

Every year during Q4, each team within the organization (eg. College, Admissions, Operations, etc) produces a retrospective analysis highlighting successes and challenges of the past year, along with opportunities for the coming year. In addition, faculty are responsible for producing a Retrospective for performance against academic metrics. Mid Q4, the Senior Leadership Team uses these retrospectives to determine the Operating Plan for the coming year at a two day offsite, highlighting one annual objective and key organization wide metrics. At the end of Q4, the leadership team presents the Operating Plan to the Make School faculty and staff.

Simultaneously, teams work to finalize strategy and targets for functions they hold ownership over, and work with the finance department to produce an annual budget necessary to reach targets. For example, the Curriculum Committee determines operating plans and changes for academic work. An overview of the distribution of ownership can be seen in the Governance Manual. The leadership team then evaluates each team’s budget holistically as part of the entire organization budget and iterates to ensure this meets spending criteria. Progress and updates to the operating plan are discussed quarterly at board meetings and with the faculty and staff at State of the School presentations and town hall discussions. These discussions will have invited all students, faculty, and staff. A high level of the operating plan will be shared in video and written format on our public github repository.

### Institutional Improvement

**Release Cycles:**
Our release cycle process is the process by which we develop and implement improvements to operational activities in every area of the college. This process is critical to Make School’s execution and delivery of an effective education. In software development, a “release cycle” refers to the cadence at which product improvements are made by the team and the resulting software update is released to users. We are using this concept in an institutional setting to help drive innovation and agility. The purpose of the release cycle process is to:

*   Ensure a high pace of innovation and improvement based on frequent student feedback.
*   Create a predictable cadence to program updates and changes, along with transparent expectations and process.
*   Combine similar types of work to improve efficiency and reduce context switching.
*   Create predictable timeline and process for stakeholder feedback and communication.

The college is subdivided into departments (eg. Academics, Student Services, Outcomes, Financial Aid, etc) and each feature area has independent owners who serve as project managers and decision makers (eg. faculty will be owners of curriculum, learning outcomes, and program review.) Large areas (such as Academics) get subdivided into smaller feature areas with individual owners - this helps distribute ownership and increase autonomy for more efficient operations.

The release cycle process is distinct from the process used to update PLOs, CLOs, propose new courses, and update course content. It is designed to be used for new or changed program ‘features’ - e.g. a new peer mentorship program, a new tool available on student dashboards to connect with corporate partners, new student housing options for the following academic year, new scholarships available, etc...

We issue a “product update” five times per year, aligned with each academic term (two in the fall, two in the spring, and one in the summer.) Not all feature areas are updated at every product release, but any updates are always planned and announced according to the release cycle process to ensure consistent process and transparency to students. For example, Student Services may be updated several times a year whereas Financial Aid may be updated only once or twice a year.

The product release cycle spans 8 weeks, with the following key milestones:

*   Week 1: Feature owners collect feedback from stakeholders through student and staff surveys and 1:1 discussions.
*   Week 2: Feature owners prioritize what to update and improve based on feedback. Owners set the timeline for research and implementation which may fit in one cycle or span across several cycles. Owners begin the research and design process, collecting deeper feedback and researching how peer institutions solve similar problems.
*   Week 4: Feature owners draft a decision doc and communications for the expected changes. Owners circulate drafts for feedback at the 20% completion mark.
*   Week 6: Feature owners circulate updated drafts to stakeholders for final feedback at the 80% mark. Expected changes announced to staff and Student Council.
*   Week 7: Updates are rolled out on our public GitHub repository, available to all students, staff, and prospective students. Communications about key changes are issued to stakeholders on a variety of channels (email, slack, live meetings).
*   Week 8: Feedback is collected from all students post-announcement. Minor tweaks and bug fixes are implemented as needed.
*   Note: when an update takes longer than one cycle to complete, Owners should target the 4th week of the appropriate cycle to collect early feedback and the 6th week to collect final feedback before release. For larger changes these are not necessarily the 4th and 6th week of the same cycle.

Combined, these planning and improvement processes allow Make School to build an ambitious and forward thinking vision by empowering individuals to innovate within their scope of ownership.
